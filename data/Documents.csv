With a limited number of publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray images, the generalization and robustness of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 cases developed based on these images are questionable. We aimed to use thousands of readily available chest radiograph images with clinical findings associated with COVID-19 as a training data set, mutually exclusive from the images with confirmed COVID-19 cases, which will be used as the testing data set. We used a deep learning model based on the ResNet-101 convolutional neural network architecture, which was pretrained to recognize objects from a million of images and then retrained to detect abnormality in chest X-ray images. The performance of the model in terms of area under the receiver operating curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 0.82, 77.3%, 71.8%, and 71.9%, respectively.

A number of deep learning-based methodologies have been recently proposed for COVID-19 screening in CT scans as a tool to automate and help with the diagnosis. These approaches, however, suffer from at least one of the following problems: (i) they treat each CT scan slice independently and (ii) the methods are trained and tested with sets of images from the same dataset. Treating the slices independently means that the same patient may appear in the training and test sets at the same time which may produce misleading results. It also raises the question of whether the scans from the same patient should be evaluated as a group or not. Moreover, using a single dataset raises concerns about the generalization of the methods. Different datasets tend to present images of varying quality which may come from different types of CT machines reflecting the conditions of the countries and cities from where they come from. In order to address these two problems, in this work, we propose an Efficient Deep Learning Technique for the screening of COVID-19 with a voting-based approach. In this approach, the images from a given patient are classified as group in a voting system. The approach is tested in the two biggest datasets of COVID-19 CT analysis with a patient-based split. A cross dataset study is also presented to assess the robustness of the models in a more realistic scenario in which data comes from different distributions. The cross-dataset analysis has shown that the generalization power of deep learning models is far from acceptable for the task since accuracy drops from 87.68% to 56.16% on the best evaluation scenario. These results highlighted that the methods that aim at COVID-19 detection in CT-images have to improve significantly to be considered as a clinical option and larger and more diverse datasets are needed to evaluate the methods in a realistic scenario.",2020,1,"Computing Department, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP)MG, Brazil; Department of Control and Automation Engineering, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP)MG, Brazil; Department of Informatics, Universidade Federal do Parana (UFPR)PR, Brazil","Chest radiography; COVID-19; Deep learning; EfficientNet; Pneumonia","Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; female; human; image analysis; image processing; information processing; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; screening test; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; transfer of learning; x-ray computed tomography","Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green","Etiology, Diagnosis",32953971,"Informatics in Medicine Unlocked",21100780477,"journal",0.363,"Q3",13,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","2015-2020","Health Informatics (Q3)","c3b53c2c31e0e194cdc261361cdd1e0dc3429d4c",2,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85091106178",7,57146225800,"Silva P.",67,65,2,3,6,20,60022764,"Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto","bra","Brazil","MG",22835431000,"Menotti D.",1563,1362,18,17,15,156,60015043,"Universidade Federal do Parana","bra","Brazil","PR",5,5,5,3.20,1065,"2020-12-03","2020-12-03","2019-12-31",0,71,0,3.2,3.2,0,"2020-09-14","2020-10-31","2020-10-31",25,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352914820305773?httpAccept=text/xml",5

We aim to compare feature engineering and deep learning methods to gain insights into the image features that drive CT-based for COVID-19 pneumonia prediction, and uncover CT image features significant for COVID-19 pneumonia from deep learning and radiomics framework. Methods: A total of 266 patients with COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia with clinical symptoms and CT signs similar to that of COVID-19 during the outbreak were retrospectively collected from three hospitals in China and the USA. All the pneumonia lesions on CT images were manually delineated by four radiologists. One hundred eighty-four patients (n = 93 COVID-19 positive; n = 91 COVID-19 negative; 24,216 pneumonia lesions from 12,001 CT image slices) from two hospitals from China served as discovery cohort for model development. Thirty-two patients (17 COVID-19 positive, 15 COVID-19 negative; 7883 pneumonia lesions from 3799 CT image slices) from a US hospital served as external validation cohort. A bi-directional adversarial network-based framework and PyRadiomics package were used to extract deep learning and radiomics features, respectively. Linear and Lasso classifiers were used to develop models predictive of COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Results: 120-dimensional deep learning image features and 120-dimensional radiomics features were extracted. Linear and Lasso classifiers identified 32 high-dimensional deep learning image features and 4 radiomics features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis (P < 0.0001). Both models achieved sensitivity > 73% and specificity > 75% on external validation cohort with slight superior performance for radiomics Lasso classifier. Human expert diagnostic performance improved (increase by 16.5% and 11.6% in sensitivity and specificity, respectively) when using a combined deep learning-radiomics model.

Materials and methods: We retrospectively included 60 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 ± 12 years; 18 females) with proven COVID-19 infection undergoing chest CT between March and May 2020. Clinical and laboratory data (within 24 h before/after chest CT) were recorded. Prototype software using a deep learning algorithm was applied for automatic segmentation and quantification of lung opacities. Percentage of opacity (PO, ground-glass and consolidations) and percentage of high opacity (PHO, consolidations), were defined as 100 times the volume of segmented abnormalities divided by the volume of the lung mask. Results: Automatic CT analysis of the lung was feasible in all patients (n = 60). The median time to accomplish automatic evaluation was 120 s (IQR: 118–128 s). In four cases (7 %), manual corrections were necessary. Patients with need for mechanical ventilation had a significantly higher PO (median 44 %, IQR: 23–58 % versus 13 %, IQR: 10–24 %; p = 0.001) and PHO (median: 11 %, IQR: 6–21 % versus 3%, IQR: 2–7 %, p = 0.002) compared to those without. The PO and PHO moderately correlated with c-reactive protein (r = 0.49−0.60, both p &lt; 0.001) and leucocyte count (r = 0.30−0.40, both p = 0.05). PO had a negative correlation with SO2 (r=−0.50, p = 0.001).

In this study, we demonstrate how transfer learning from deep learning models can be used to perform COVID-19 detection using images from three most commonly used medical imaging modes X-Ray, Ultrasound, and CT scan. The aim is to provide over-stressed medical professionals a second pair of eyes through intelligent deep learning image classification models. We identify a suitable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model through initial comparative study of several popular CNN models. We then optimize the selected VGG19 model for the image modalities to show how the models can be used for the highly scarce and challenging COVID-19 datasets. We highlight the challenges (including dataset size and quality) in utilizing current publicly available COVID-19 datasets for developing useful deep learning models and how it adversely impacts the trainability of complex models. We also propose an image pre-processing stage to create a trustworthy image dataset for developing and testing the deep learning models. The new approach is aimed to reduce unwanted noise from the images so that deep learning models can focus on detecting diseases with specific features from them. Our results indicate that Ultrasound images provide superior detection accuracy compared to X-Ray and CT scans. The experimental results highlight that with limited data, most of the deeper networks struggle to train well and provides less consistency over the three imaging modes we are using. The selected VGG19 model, which is then extensively tuned with appropriate parameters, performs in considerable levels of COVID-19 detection against pneumonia or normal for all three lung image modes with the precision of up to 86% for X-Ray, 100% for Ultrasound and 84% for CT scans.",2020,2,"Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS), School of Information Systems, and Modeling, Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW  2007, Australia; Machine Vision and Digital Health (MaViDH), School of Computing and Mathematics, Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, NSW  2795, Australia; Manning Rural Referral Hospital, Taree, NSW  2430, Australia; Department of Energy and Mineral Resources Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, 05006, South Korea; IBM Australia Limited, Sydney, NSW  2065, Australia","CNN models; COVID-19 detection; image processing; model comparison; ultrasound and CT based detection; X-ray","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Statistical tests; Transfer learning; Ultrasonic applications; X rays; Classification models; Comparative studies; Detection accuracy; Image preprocessing; Medical professionals; Multi-modal imaging; Treatment plans; Ultrasound images; Computerized tomography","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,"","IEEE Access",21100374601,"journal",0.775,"Q1",86,"United States","Northern America","2013-2020","Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Engineering (miscellaneous) (Q1); Materials Science (miscellaneous) (Q2)","a4f6084fac9522ee48b533f2eb73ac5e8ab52d40",14,0,1,1,1,"2-s2.0-85090281227",7,57218795792,"Horry M.",2,2,1,1,1,6,60023932,"University of Technology Sydney","aus","Australia","NSW",24179276600,"Shukla N.",620,538,5,14,16,90,60023932,"University of Technology Sydney","aus","Australia","NSW",1,NULL,1,7.00,1395,"2020-11-03","2020-08-25","2019-12-31",0,93,0,7,7,0,"2020-08-14","2021-02-28","2020-10-21",104,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09167243.pdf?arnumber=9167243",6

To realize our motivation, we on the one hand adopt deep learning techniques to analyse CT images of patients. The transfer learning and data augmentation techniques are adopted for the lacking of samples in our obtained CT image data set. We build a model by designing and training a new deep network to help clinic doctors to make an appropriate diagnose decision. On the other hand, according to the spreading characteristics of COVID-19 and the controlling measures adopted by Chinese government, we propose to modify the classic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and establish a new SEIR dynamics model with considering the infectiousness of the people in the latent period and the quarantine period. The appropriate parameters of our modified SEIR model are learned by using deep learning techniques.

At the end of 2019, COVID-19 emerged as a previously unknown respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The world health organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic in the second week of March 2020. Simultaneous deep learning detection and classification of COVID-19 based on the full resolution of digital X-ray images is the key to efficiently assisting patients by enabling physicians to reach a fast and accurate diagnosis decision. In this paper, a simultaneous deep learning computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on the YOLO predictor is proposed that can detect and diagnose COVID-19, differentiating it from eight other respiratory diseases: atelectasis, infiltration, pneumothorax, masses, effusion, pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and nodules. The proposed CAD system was assessed via five-fold tests for the multi-class prediction problem using two different databases of chest X-ray images: COVID-19 and ChestX-ray8. The proposed CAD system was trained with an annotated training set of 50,490 chest X-ray images. The regions on the entire X-ray images with lesions suspected of being due to COVID-19 were simultaneously detected and classified end-to-end via the proposed CAD predictor, achieving overall detection and classification accuracies of 96.31% and 97.40%, respectively. Most test images from patients with confirmed COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases were correctly predicted, achieving average intersection over union (IoU) greater than 90%. Applying deep learning regularizers of data balancing and augmentation improved the COVID-19 diagnostic performance by 6.64% and 12.17% in terms of the overall accuracy and the F1-score, respectively. It is feasible to achieve a diagnosis based on individual chest X-ray images with the proposed CAD system within 0.0093 s. Thus, the CAD system presented in this paper can make a prediction at the rate of 108 frames/s (FPS), which is close to real-time. The proposed deep learning CAD system can reliably differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases. The proposed deep learning model seems to be a reliable tool that can be used to practically assist health care systems, patients, and physicians. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,0,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Software, Kyung Hee University, 1732, Deogyeong-daero, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do  17104, South Korea; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Sana’a Community College, Sana’a, Yemen","Artificial intelligence (AI), Deep learning; COVID-19; Diagnosis; Respiratory diseases; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","Computer aided instruction; Deep learning; E-learning; Learning systems; Pulmonary diseases; Chest X-ray image; Class prediction; Classification accuracy; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Diagnostic performance; Health-care system; Overall accuracies; World Health Organization; Computer aided diagnosis","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",NULL,NULL,"Applied Intelligence",23674,"journal",0.726,"Q2",58,"Netherlands","Western Europe","1991-2020","Artificial Intelligence (Q2)","4bb724b644ea12c1963246e5d68b44cf512e624c",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096820429",4,57189003551,"Al-antari M.",403,307,4,8,5,31,60001873,"Kyung Hee University","kor","South Korea","Seoul",8956579500,"Lee S.",9173,7943,1,40,29,522,60001873,"Kyung Hee University","kor","South Korea","Seoul",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-11-28","2020-11-28","2020-11-28",35,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10489-020-02076-6.pdf",3

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging both play an important role in COVID-19 diagnosis. Chest CT imaging offers the benefits of quick reporting, a low cost, and high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary infection. Recently, deep-learning-based computer vision methods have demonstrated great promise for use in medical imaging applications, including X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT imaging. However, training a deep-learning model requires large volumes of data, and medical staff faces a high risk when collecting COVID-19 CT data due to the high infectivity of the disease. Another issue is the lack of experts available for data labeling. In order to meet the data requirements for COVID-19 CT imaging, we propose a CT image synthesis approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network that can effectively generate high-quality and realistic COVID-19 CT images for use in deep-learning-based medical imaging tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art image synthesis methods with the generated COVID-19 CT images and indicates promising for various machine learning applications including semantic segmentation and classification.",2020,0,"School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University School of Electrical Engineering, 542974 Seongbuk-gu, Korea (the Republic of), 02841 (e-mail: yfjiang@ispl.korea.ac.kr); School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University School of Electrical Engineering, 542974 Seongbuk-gu, Korea (the Republic of), (e-mail: hanchen@ispl.korea.ac.kr); Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Department, The George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, United States, (e-mail: loew@gwu.edu); School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Univ, Seoul, Korea (the Republic of), 02841 (e-mail: hsko@korea.ac.kr)","computed topography; conditional generative adversarial network; COVID-19; image synthesis","Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Personnel training; Polymerase chain reaction; Semantics; Adversarial networks; Data requirements; Imaging applications; Machine learning applications; Pulmonary infections; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Semantic segmentation; State of the art; Computerized tomography","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",NULL,NULL,"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics",21100256982,"journal",1.306,"Q1",115,"United States","Northern America","2013-2020","Biotechnology (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Health Information Management (Q1)","be1aa17b889473fb16694b40d61e913080d50124",3,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85097960653",4,57207334917,"Jiang Y.",4,4,1,2,5,6,60005273,"Korea University","kor","South Korea","Seoul",35069749800,"Ko H.",1471,1318,1,18,31,268,60005273,"Korea University","kor","South Korea","Seoul",3,2,2,0.50,690,"2021-02-25","2021-02-21","2021-01-31",0,46,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,"2020-12-04","2021-03-08","2021-3-8",55,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6221020/9348958/09281375.pdf?arnumber=9281375",2

Methods: In this study, 800, 170, and 171 pairs of ultra-low-dose and full-dose CT images were used as input/output as training, test, and external validation set, respectively, to implement the full-dose prediction technique. A residual convolutional neural network was applied to generate full-dose from ultra-low-dose CT images. The quality of predicted CT images was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Scores ranging from 1 to 5 were assigned reflecting subjective assessment of image quality and related COVID-19 features, including ground glass opacities (GGO), crazy paving (CP), consolidation (CS), nodular infiltrates (NI), bronchovascular thickening (BVT), and pleural effusion (PE). Results: The radiation dose in terms of CT dose index (CTDIvol) was reduced by up to 89%. The RMSE decreased from 0.16 ± 0.05 to 0.09 ± 0.02 and from 0.16 ± 0.06 to 0.08 ± 0.02 for the predicted compared with ultra-low-dose CT images in the test and external validation set, respectively. The overall scoring assigned by radiologists showed an acceptance rate of 4.72 ± 0.57 out of 5 for reference full-dose CT images, while ultra-low-dose CT images rated 2.78 ± 0.9. The predicted CT images using the deep learning algorithm achieved a score of 4.42 ± 0.8. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that the deep learning algorithm is capable of predicting standard full-dose CT images with acceptable quality for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 positive patients with substantial radiation dose reduction. Key Points: • Ultra-low-dose CT imaging of COVID-19 patients would result in the loss of critical information about lesion types, which could potentially affect clinical diagnosis. • Deep learning–based prediction of full-dose from ultra-low-dose CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 could reduce the radiation dose by up to 89%. • Deep learning algorithms failed to recover the correct lesion structure/density for a number of patients considered outliers, and as such, further research and development is warranted to address these limitations. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,1,"Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Geneva University Hospital, Geneva, CH-1211, Switzerland; Department of Radiology Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical, Tehran, Iran; Department of Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Department of Physiology, Pharmacology and Medical Physics, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Iran; Department of Radiology, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran; Rajaie Cardiovascular, Medical & Research Center, Iran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran; Department of Radiology, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Iran; Department of Radiation Oncology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Department of Radiologic Sciences and Medical Physics, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical sciences, Kerman, Iran; Geneva University Neurocenter, Geneva University, Geneva, CH-1205, Switzerland; Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Deep learning; Tomography X-ray computed","","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",NULL,32879987,"European Radiology",16687,"journal",1.579,"Q1",143,"Germany","Western Europe","1991-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q1); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q1)","cfff5dd73a939a1e576ae83276956026f38af0ec",6,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85090091243",14,57191829519,"Shiri I.",346,258,4,11,6,96,60009963,"Hôpitaux universitaires de Genève","che","Switzerland","GE",57213309899,"Zaidi H.",138,93,2,6,8,109,60004718,"Université de Genève","che","Switzerland","GE",6,4,5,7.75,969,"2021-02-28","2020-09-03","2020-09-02",0,57,0,7.75,0.25,0.25,"2020-09-03","2021-03-09","2021-2-12",33,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00330-020-07225-6.pdf",5

These techniques can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. Due to the small COVID-19 dataset available, the pre-trained neural networks can be used for diagnosis of coronavirus. However, these techniques applied on chest CT image is very limited till now. Hence, the main aim of this paper to use the pre-trained deep learning architectures as an automated tool to detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 in chest CT. A DenseNet201 based deep transfer learning (DTL) is proposed to classify the patients as COVID infected or not i.e. COVID-19 (+) or COVID (−). The proposed model is utilized to extract features by using its own learned weights on the ImageNet dataset along with a convolutional neural structure. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the propose DTL model on COVID-19 chest CT scan images.

To demonstrate its utility, we conducted four case studies. 1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR can improve deep-learning performance for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT classification. 2) We provided a baseline to distinguish COVID-19, influenza, and normal or other disease types on CT. 3) We performed anomaly detection of COVID-19 by training an unsupervised one-class classifier. 4) We compared clinical symptoms and findings of COVID-19 and influenza to demonstrate their differences in the text. We believe our work is complementary to existing resources and hope it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using this novel method, the proposed model can both take in a large number of heterogeneous features, such as census data, intra-county mobility, inter-county mobility, social distancing data, past growth of infection, among others, and learn complex interactions between these features. Using data collected from various sources, we estimate the range of increase in infected cases seven days into the future for all U.S. counties. In addition, we use the model to identify the most influential features for prediction of the growth of infection. We also analyze pairs of features and estimate the amount of observed second-order interaction between them. Experiments show that the proposed model obtains satisfactory predictive performance and fairly interpretable feature analysis results; hence, the proposed model could complement the standard epidemiological models for national-level surveillance of pandemics, such as COVID-19. The results and findings obtained from the deep learning model could potentially inform policymakers and researchers in devising effective mitigation and response strategies.

To this end, there have been few works proposed to diagnose COVID-19 by using CXR-based methods. However, they have limited performance as they ignore the spatial relationships between the region of interests (ROIs) in CXR images, which could identify the likely regions of COVID-19’s effect in the human lungs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based deep learning model using the attention module with VGG-16. By using the attention module, we capture the spatial relationship between the ROIs in CXR images. In the meantime, by using an appropriate convolution layer (4th pooling layer) of the VGG-16 model in addition to the attention module, we design a novel deep learning model to perform fine-tuning in the classification process. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct extensive experiments by using three COVID-19 CXR image datasets. The experiment and analysis demonstrate the stable and promising performance of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The promising classification performance of our proposed method indicates that it is suitable for CXR image classification in COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,0,"School of Information Technology, Deakin University, 75 Pigdons Rd, Waurn Ponds, Geelong, VIC  3216, Australia","Chest x-rays; Classification; COVID-19; Deep learning; SARS-CoV2","Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Image classification; Learning systems; Polymerase chain reaction; Classification performance; Classification process; Computed tomography scan; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Experiment and analysis; Region of interest; Spatial relationships; State-of-the-art methods; Computer aided diagnosis","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,NULL,"Applied Intelligence",23674,"journal",0.726,"Q2",58,"Netherlands","Western Europe","1991-2020","Artificial Intelligence (Q2)","d9a39add8f493a1286314c2a9f3ee336205913d2",5,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096074577",2,57209830830,"Sitaula C.",7,5,5,2,2,6,60018805,"Deakin University","aus","Australia","VIC",56177537500,"Hossain M.",22,21,3,2,7,17,60018805,"Deakin University","aus","Australia","VIC",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-11-17","2020-11-17","2020-11-17",49,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10489-020-02055-x.pdf",3

Existing deep learning approaches heavily rely on large labeled data sets, which are difficult to acquire in this pandemic situation. Therefore, weakly-supervised approaches are in demand. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end weakly-supervised COVID-19 detection approach, ResNext+, that only requires volume level data labels and can provide slice level prediction. The proposed approach incorporates a lung segmentation mask as well as spatial and channel attention to extract spatial features. Besides, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized to acquire the axial dependency of the slices. Moreover, a slice attention module is applied before the final fully connected layer to generate the slice level prediction without additional supervision. An ablation study is conducted to show the efficiency of the attention blocks and the segmentation mask block. Experimental results, obtained from publicly available datasets, show a precision of 81.9% and F1 score of 81.4%. The closest state-of-the-art gives 76.7% precision and 78.8% F1 score. The 5% improvement in precision and 3% in the F1 score demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of infected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data. Because the outbreak is recent, it is difficult to gather a significant number of radiographic images in such a short time. Therefore, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based model called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. By adding synthetic images produced by CovidGAN,the accuracy increased to 95%.

METHOD: This study applied transfer learning method to develop deep learning models for detecting COVID-19 disease. Three existing state-of-the-art deep learning models namely, Inception ResNetV2, InceptionNetV3 and NASNetLarge, were selected and fine-tuned to automatically detect and diagnose COVID-19 disease using chest X-ray images. A dataset involving 850 images with the confirmed COVID-19 disease, 500 images of community-acquired (non-COVID-19) pneumonia cases and 915 normal chest X-ray images was used in this study. RESULTS: Among the three models, InceptionNetV3 yielded the best performance with accuracy levels of 98.63% and 99.02% with and without using data augmentation in model training, respectively. All the performed networks tend to overfitting (with high training accuracy) when data augmentation is not used, this is due to the limited amount of image data used for training and validation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a deep transfer learning is feasible to detect COVID-19 disease automatically from chest X-ray by training the learning model with chest X-ray images mixed with COVID-19 patients, other pneumonia affected patients and people with healthy lungs, which may help doctors more effectively make their clinical decisions. The study also gives an insight to how transfer learning was used to automatically detect the COVID-19 disease. In future studies, as the amount of available dataset increases, different convolution neutral network models could be designed to achieve the goal more efficiently. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Globally, more than 14.6 M people have been diagnosed and more than 595 K deaths are reported. Currently, no effective vaccine or drugs are available to combat COVID-19. Therefore, the whole world is looking for new drug candidates that can treat the COVID-19. In this study, we conducted a virtual screening of natural compounds using a deep-learning method. A deep-learning algorithm was used for the predictive modeling of a CHEMBL3927 dataset of inhibitors of Main protease (Mpro). Several predictive models were developed and evaluated based on R2, MAE MSE, RMSE, and Loss. The best model with R2=0.83, MAE = 1.06, MSE = 1.5, RMSE = 1.2, and loss = 1.5 was deployed on the Selleck database containing 1611 natural compounds for virtual screening. The model predicted 500 hits showing the value score between 6.9 and 3.8. The screened compounds were further enriched by molecular docking resulting in 39 compounds based on comparison with the reference (X77). Out of them, only four compounds were found to be drug-like and three were non-toxic. The complexes of compounds and Mpro were finally subjected to Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation for 100 ns. The MMPBSA result showed that two compounds Palmatine and Sauchinone formed very stable complex with Mpro and had free energy of −71.47 kJ mol−1 and −71.68 kJ mol−1 respectively as compared to X77 (−69.58 kJ mol−1). From this study, we can suggest that the identified natural compounds may be considered for therapeutic development against the SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), also known as novel coronavirus or SARSCoV- 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2), is a respiratory based touch contiguous disease. The catastrophic situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic posed a serious threat to societies globally. The whole world is making tremendous efforts to combat this life-threatening disease. For taking remedial action and planning preventive measures on time, there is an urgent need for efficient prediction models to confront the COVID-19 outbreak. A deep learning-based ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model is proposed in this article for predicting the COVID-19 outbreak by utilizing real-time information from the WHO's daily bulletin report as well as provides information regarding clinical trials across the world. To evaluate the suitability and performance of our proposed model compared to other well-established prediction models, an experimental study has been performed. To estimate the prediction results, the three performance measures, i.e., Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of determination (R2 Score), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) have been employed. The prediction results of fifty countries substantiated the fact that the proposed ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model performs very well as compared to other models. The proposed model archives the lowest RMSE, lowest MAPE, and highest R2 Score throughout the testing, under varied selection criteria (country- wise). This article aims to contribute a deep learning-based solution for the wellbeing of livings and to provide the current status of clinical trials across the globe. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Therefore, it is important to study computerized models for infectious detection based on CT imaging. New deep learning-based approaches are developed for CT assisted diagnosis of COVID-19. However, most of the current studies are based on a small size dataset of COVID-19 CT images as there are less publicly available datasets for patient privacy reasons. As a result, the performance of deep learning-based detection models needs to be improved based on a small size dataset. In this paper, a stacked autoencoder detector model is proposed to greatly improve the performance of the detection models such as precision rate and recall rate. Firstly, four autoencoders are constructed as the first four layers of the whole stacked autoencoder detector model being developed to extract better features of CT images. Secondly, the four autoencoders are cascaded together and connected to the dense layer and the softmax classifier to constitute the model. Finally, a new classification loss function is constructed by superimposing reconstruction loss to enhance the detection accuracy of the model. The experiment results show that our model is performed well on a small size COVID-2019 CT image dataset. Our model achieves the average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score rate of 94.7%, 96.54%, 94.1%, and 94.8%, respectively. The results reflect the ability of our model in discriminating COVID-19 images which might help radiologists in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,0,"School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, 210044, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, 518000, China; School of Automation, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, 210044, China","Computed tomography; COVID-19 diagnosis; Deep learning; Stacked autoencoder","Deep learning; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Auto encoders; Detection accuracy; Detection models; Detector modeling; Learning-based approach; Loss functions; Patient privacies; Precision rates; Computerized tomography","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,NULL,"Applied Intelligence",23674,"journal",0.726,"Q2",58,"Netherlands","Western Europe","1991-2020","Artificial Intelligence (Q2)","3c615813018e52f5fb503fe0111fd251f5cfd254",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096138608",3,57219925030,"Li D.",0,0,1,0,1,2,121519926,"Peng Cheng Laboratory","chn","China","Guangdong",57221066731,"Xu J.",0,0,1,0,1,2,60064143,"Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","chn","China","Jiangsu",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-11-09","2020-11-09","2020-11-9",41,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10489-020-02002-w.pdf",3

The detection of COVID-19 using artificial intelligence techniques and especially deep learning will help to detect this virus in early stages which will reflect in increasing the opportunities of fast recovery of patients worldwide. This will lead to release the pressure off the healthcare system around the world. In this research, classical data augmentation techniques along with Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN) based on a deep transfer learning model for COVID-19 detection in chest CT scan images will be presented. The limited benchmark datasets for COVID-19 especially in chest CT images are the main motivation of this research. The main idea is to collect all the possible images for COVID-19 that exists until the very writing of this research and use the classical data augmentations along with CGAN to generate more images to help in the detection of the COVID-19. In this study, five different deep convolutional neural network-based models (AlexNet, VGGNet16, VGGNet19, GoogleNet, and ResNet50) have been selected for the investigation to detect the Coronavirus-infected patient using chest CT radiographs digital images. The classical data augmentations along with CGAN improve the performance of classification in all selected deep transfer models.

The current diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 follows reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based approach which however is less sensitive to identify the virus at the initial stage. Hence, a more robust and alternate diagnosis technique is desirable. Recently, with the release of publicly available datasets of corona positive patients comprising of computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging; scientists, researchers and healthcare experts are contributing for faster and automated diagnosis of COVID-19 by identifying pulmonary infections using deep learning approaches to achieve better cure and treatment. These datasets have limited samples concerned with the positive COVID-19 cases, which raise the challenge for unbiased learning. Following from this context, this article presents the random oversampling and weighted class loss function approach for unbiased fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) in various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2, DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge to perform binary classification (as normal and COVID-19 cases) and also multi-class classification (as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal case) of posteroanterior CXR images. Accuracy, precision, recall, loss, and area under the curve (AUC) are utilized to evaluate the performance of the models. Considering the experimental results, the performance of each model is scenario dependent; however, NASNetLarge displayed better scores in contrast to other architectures, which is further compared with other recently proposed approaches.

An urgent need for early diagnosis is required for precise treatment, which in turn reduces the pressure in the health care system. Some of the standard image diagnosis available is Computed Tomography (CT) scan and Chest X-Ray (CXR). Even though a CT scan is considered a gold standard in diagnosis, CXR is most widely used due to widespread, faster, and cheaper. This study aims to provide a solution for identifying pneumonia due to COVID-19 and healthy lungs (normal person) using CXR images. One of the remarkable methods used for extracting a high dimensional feature from medical images is the Deep learning method. In this research, the state-of-the-art techniques used is Genetic Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (GDCNN). It is trained from the scratch for extracting features for classifying them between COVID-19 and normal images. A dataset consisting of more than 5000 CXR image samples is used for classifying pneumonia, normal and other pneumonia diseases. Training a GDCNN from scratch proves that, the proposed method performs better compared to other transfer learning techniques. Classification accuracy of 98.84%, the precision of 93%, the sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 97.0% in COVID-19 prediction is achieved.

The daily life of human beings, their health, and the economy of a country are affected due to this deadly viral disease. Covid-19 is a common spreading disease, and till now, not a single country can prepare a vaccine for COVID-19. A clinical study of COVID-19 infected patients has shown that these types of patients are mostly infected from a lung infection after coming in contact with this disease. Chest x-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT are a more effective imaging technique for diagnosing lunge related problems. Still, a substantial chest x-ray is a lower cost process in comparison to chest CT. Deep learning is the most successful technique of machine learning, which provides useful analysis to study a large amount of chest x-ray images that can critically impact on screening of Covid-19. In this work, we have taken the PA view of chest x-ray scans for covid-19 affected patients as well as healthy patients. After cleaning up the images and applying data augmentation, we have used deep learning-based CNN models and compared their performance. We have compared Inception V3, Xception, and ResNeXt models and examined their accuracy. To analyze the model performance, 6432 chest x-ray scans samples have been collected from the Kaggle repository, out of which 5467 were used for training and 965 for validation. In result analysis, the Xception model gives the highest accuracy (i.e., 97.97%) for detecting Chest X-rays images as compared to other models.

Most real-world time series data have a spatial dimension as an additional context which is often expressed in terms of coordinates of the region of interest (such as latitude - longitude information). However, existing techniques are limited to handle spatial and temporal contextual attributes in an integrated and meaningful way considering both spatial and temporal dependency between observations. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning framework is proposed to solve the unsupervised anomaly detection problem in multivariate spatio-temporal data. The proposed framework works with unlabeled data and no prior knowledge about anomalies are assumed. As a case study, we use the public COVID-19 data provided by the Italian Department of Civil Protection. Northern Italy regions’ COVID-19 data are used to train the framework; and then any abnormal trends or upswings in COVID-19 data of central and southern Italian regions are detected. The proposed framework detects early signals of the COVID-19 outbreak in test regions based on the reconstruction error. For performance comparison, we perform a detailed evaluation of 15 algorithms on the COVID-19 Italy dataset including the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Experimental results show that our framework shows significant improvement on unsupervised anomaly detection performance even in data scarce and high contamination ratio scenarios (where the ratio of anomalies in the data set is more than 5%).

The growing market share of Chinese tourism and the fact that the county was the first to experience the pandemic make China a suitable proxy for predictions on global tourism. We employ data from the 2003 SARS outbreak to train a deep learning artificial neural network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The neural network is calibrated for the particulars of the current pandemic. Our findings, which are cross-validated using backtesting, suggest that recovery of arrivals to pre-crisis levels can take from 6 to 12 months and this can have significant adverse effects not only on the tourism industry but also on other sectors that interact with it. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,10,"College of Business, Zayed University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland","China; Coronavirus; deep learning; long short term memory; tourism development; USA","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,"","Tourism Recreation Research",16563,"journal",0.541,"Q1",41,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","1976-2020","Cultural Studies (Q1); Geography, Planning and Development (Q2); Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law (Q2); Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management (Q2)","b82f9e0c3b0886f656ed5adebed350125859e917",16,0,2,1,1,"2-s2.0-85087494570",3,56896929600,"Polyzos S.",84,72,12,5,7,15,60070818,"Zayed University","are","United Arab Emirates","Abu Dhabi",57209232571,"Spyridou A.",30,27,3,3,2,8,60027012,"Gdańsk University of Technology","pol","Poland",NULL,1,1,1,1.00,1920,"2020-08-26","2020-08-26","2020-06-25",0,128,0,1,0,0,"2020-06-26","2021-01-21","2020-6-26",49,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02508281.2020.1777053",8

Methods: A total of 563 chest CT scans of 380 patients (227/380 were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia) from 5 hospitals were collected to train our deep learning (DL) model. Lung regions were extracted by U-net, then transformed and fed to pre-trained ResNet-50-based IDANNet (Identification and Analysis of New covid-19 Net) to produce a diagnostic probability. Fivefold cross-validation was employed to validate the application of our model. Another 318 scans of 316 patients (243/316 were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia) from 2 other hospitals were enrolled prospectively as the RWDs to testify our DL model’s performance and compared it with that from 3 experienced radiologists. Results: A three-dimensional DL model was successfully established. The diagnostic threshold to differentiate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia was 0.685 with an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI: 0.886–0.913) in the internal validation group. In the RWD cohort, our model achieved an AUC of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.851–0.876) with the sensitivity of 0.811 and the specificity of 0.822, non-inferior to the performance of 3 experienced radiologists, suggesting promising clinical practical usage. Conclusions: The established DL model was able to achieve accurate identification of COVID-19 pneumonia from other suspected ones in the real-world situation, which could become a reliable tool in clinical routine. Key Points: • In an internal validation set, our DL model achieved the best performance to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with a sensitivity of 0.836, a specificity of 0.800, and an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI: 0.886–0.913) when the threshold was set at 0.685. • In the prospective RWD cohort, our DL diagnostic model achieved a sensitivity of 0.811, a specificity of 0.822, and AUC of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.851–0.876), non-inferior to the performance of 3 experienced radiologists. • The attention heatmaps were fully generated by the model without additional manual annotation and the attention regions were highly aligned with the ROIs acquired by human radiologists for diagnosis. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.",2020,0,"Department of Radiology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, 12 Middle Wulumuqi Rd., Jing’an District, Shanghai, 200040, China; Shanghai Yidan Information Technology Co., Ltd; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Shanghai Institute for Advanced Communication and Data Science, School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Shanghai Institute for Advanced Communication and Data Science, School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Radiology, Fuyang No. 2 People’s Hospital, 450 Linquan Road, Fuyang, Anhui Province, China","COVID-19; Deep learning; Differential diagnosis","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",NULL,33372243,"European Radiology",16687,"journal",1.579,"Q1",143,"Germany","Western Europe","1991-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q1); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q1)","16d26a00f768ae65fcc3083bcd128e677b26c6cd",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85098102978",9,57221094050,"Xie Q.",0,0,1,0,1,8,60009860,"Fudan University","chn","China",NULL,57202598244,"Yin B.",559,529,11,13,13,223,60009860,"Fudan University","chn","China",NULL,1,1,1,0.25,255,"2020-12-31","2020-12-31","2020-12-27",0,15,0,0.25,0.25,0.25,"2020-12-28","2020-12-29","2020-12-29",25,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00330-020-07553-7.pdf",2

A custom convolutional neural network and a selection of ImageNet pretrained models are trained and evaluated at patient-level on publicly available CXR collections to learn modality-specific feature representations. The learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying CXRs as normal, showing bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19-viral abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs.

Unfortunately, most of them are useless for the physician due that they are not available tools that are part of their workflow. At present, Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) are the standard platforms used in clinical environments to store and transmit electronic images and the reading reports. Therefore, the integration of the automatic analysis tools with these systems is required to allow validation by physicians and the use in clinical and medical research. This paper presents a simple way of adding the use of machine learning models for the automatic analysis of medical images in the radiological workflow using DICOM services provided by open source tools.

Recent health crises, such as Ebola, influenza A, SARS, and Covid-19, have highlighted the importance of communication. When designing communication campaigns during a crisis, the speed of the creation of messages and their effectiveness have relevant social consequences. The objective of this work is to design and develop a mathematical tool, based on Machine Learning techniques, to enable predictions of areas of visual attention quickly and accurately without the use of eye-tracking technology. The methodology combines deep learning algorithms, to extract the characteristics of the images, and supervised modeling mathematical techniques, to predict the areas of attention. Validation is carried out by analyzing various institutional communications from the Covid-19 campaign, comparing the results with the areas of attention obtained using an eye-tracking solution with proven accuracy.

Chest CT imaging has been widely used in clinical practice for disease diagnosis, but image reading is still a time-consuming work. We aim to integrate an image preprocessing technology for anomaly detection with supervised deep learning for chest CT imaging-based COVID-19 diagnosis. In this study, a matrix profile technique was introduced to CT image anomaly detection in two levels. At one-dimensional level, CT images were simply flatted and transformed to a one-dimensional vector so that the matrix profile algorithm could be implemented for them directly. At two-dimensional level,a matrix profile was calculated in a sliding window way for every segment in the image. An anomaly severity score (CT-SS) was calculated, and the difference of the CT-SS between the COVID-19 CT images and Non-COVID-19 CT images was tested. A sparse anomaly mask was calculated and applied to penalize the pixel values of each image. The anomaly weighted images were then used to train standard DenseNet deep learning models to distinguish the COVID-19 CT from Non-COVID-19 CT images. A VGG19 model was used as a baseline model for comparison. Although extra finetuning needs to be done manually, the one-dimensional matrix profile method could identify the anomalies successfully. Using the two-dimensional matrix profiling method, CT-SS and anomaly weighted image can be successfully generated for each image. The CT-SS significantly differed among the COVID-19 CT images and Non-COVID-19 CT images (p-value < 0.05 ). Furthermore, we identified a potential causal association between the number of underlying diseases of a COVID-19 patient and the severity of the disease through statistical mediation analysis. Compared to the raw images, the anomaly weighted images showed generally better performance in training the DenseNet models with different architectures for diagnosing COVID-19, which was validated using two publicly available COVID-19 lung CT image datasets. The metric Area Under the Curve(AUC) on one dataset were 0.7799(weighted)vs. 0.7391(unweighted), 0.7812(weighted) vs. 0.7410(unweighted), 0.7780(weighted) vs. 0.7399(unweighted), 0.7045(weighted) vs. 0.6910(unweighted) for DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and the baseline model VGG19, respectively. The same trend was observed using another independent dataset. The significant results revealed the critical value of using this existing state-of-The-Art algorithm for image anomaly detection. Furthermore, the end-To-end model structure has the potential to work as a rapid tool for clinical imaging-based diagnosis. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,0,"Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB  R3E 0J9, Canada","COVID-19 CT images; DenseNet; matrix profile; mediation analysis; Rare pattern mining; risk score","Anomaly detection; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Area under the curves; Clinical practices; Disease diagnosis; Image preprocessing; Mediation analysis; Profile algorithms; Profiling methods; State-of-the-art algorithms; Computerized tomography","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold",NULL,"","IEEE Access",21100374601,"journal",0.775,"Q1",86,"United States","Northern America","2013-2020","Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Engineering (miscellaneous) (Q1); Materials Science (miscellaneous) (Q2)","5749389060a8ea14716f0c78f378df7840c248fa",2,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85097130839",3,57204903280,"Liu Q.",26,25,7,2,4,21,60009697,"University of Manitoba","can","Canada","MB",8957120500,"Hu P.",3219,3142,2,26,20,2100,60009697,"University of Manitoba","can","Canada","MB",3,3,3,2.70,195,"2020-12-31","2021-01-01","2019-12-31",0,13,0,2.7,2.7,2.7,"2020-11-25","2021-03-10","2021-1-13",47,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09268138.pdf?arnumber=9268138",3

In the past, the research on convolution neural network design and color recognition is still in the traditional method, and the field of computer vision is not really combined with the traditional decorative fabric. This paper proposes a solution based on deep learning. Color learning and main color recognition can be processed as a whole. By introducing convolution neural network, the scheme can learn color features directly from the image itself, and the process of artificial design features is omitted. While simplifying the process of model building and training, the potential information association can be obtained, so as to obtain better recognition effect. In addition, due to the deep depth of the network, this paper uses the initial optimization module to avoid the performance degradation and over fitting in the training process. This method has an important reference value for the color design of modern hand decoration, and can promote the development of hand decoration during the popularity of covid-19. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

As a consequence, there are disruptions in human and economic activities all over the globe. The recovery process is also expected to be rough. Economic activities impact social behaviors, which leave signatures in satellite images that can be automatically detected and classified. Satellite imagery can support the decision-making of analysts and policymakers by providing a different kind of visibility into the unfolding economic changes. In this work, we use a deep learning approach that combines strategic location sampling and an ensemble of lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize specific elements in satellite images and compute economic indicators based on it, automatically. This CNN ensemble framework ranked third place in the US Department of Defense xView challenge, the most advanced benchmark for object detection in satellite images. We show the potential of our framework for temporal analysis using the US IARPA Function Map of the World (fMoW) dataset.

Given the limited availability of testing kits with long turn-around test times and the exponentially increasing number of COVID-19 positive cases, X-rays offer an additional cheap and fast modality for screening COVID-19 positive patients, especially for patients exhibiting respiratory symptoms. In this paper, we propose a solution based on a combination of deep learning and radiomic features for assisting radiologists during the diagnosis of COVID-19. The proposed system of CovidDiagnosis takes a chest X-ray image and passes it through a pipeline comprising of a model for lung isolation, followed by classification of the lung regions into four disease classes, namely Healthy, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis and COVID-19. To assist our classification framework, we employ embeddings of disease symptoms produced by the CheXNet network by creating an ensemble. The proposed approach gives remarkable classification results on publicly available datasets of chest X-rays. Additionally, the system produces visualization maps which highlight the symptoms responsible for producing the classification decisions. This provides trustworthy and interpretable decisions to radiologists for the clinical deployment of CovidDiagnosis. Further, we calibrate our network using temperature scaling to give confidence scores which are representative of true correctness likelihood. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,0,"TCS Research, New Delhi, India; BITS Pilani, Sancoale, Goa, India","Coronavirus; COVID-19; CovidDiagnosis; Radiomics; X-rays","Automation; Biological organs; Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Deep learning; Image analysis; Medical imaging; Automated systems; Chest X-ray image; Classification decision; Classification framework; Classification results; Health-care system; Respiratory symptoms; Temperature scaling; Diagnosis","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Springer","English","Conference Paper","Final","",NULL,NULL,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"4fe34ab1851e081cfd9e5dcc5dc6e6d9606163f8",0,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85097261834",9,57207792277,"Mahajan K.",10,10,4,2,3,13,60069548,"Tata Consultancy Services India","ind","India","MH",6601910743,"Shroff G.",1040,1001,6,11,34,120,60069548,"Tata Consultancy Services India","ind","India","MH",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-11-03","2020-11-03","2020-11-3",31,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-62469-9_6",3

The usage of sophisticated artificial intelligence technology (AI) and the radiological images can help in diagnosing the disease reliably and addressing the problem of the shortage of trained doctors in remote villages. In this research, the automated diagnosis of Coronavirus disease was performed using a dataset of X-ray images of patients with severe bacterial pneumonia, reported COVID-19 disease, and normal cases. The goal of the study is to analyze the achievements for medical image recognition of state-of-the-art neural networking architectures. Transfer Learning technique has been implemented in this work. Transfer learning is an ambitious task, but it results in impressive outcomes for identifying distinct patterns in tiny datasets of medical images. The findings indicate that deep learning with X-ray imagery could retrieve important biomarkers relevant for COVID-19 disease detection. Since all diagnostic measures show failure levels that pose questions, the scientific profession should determine the probability of integration of X-rays with the clinical treatment, utilizing the results.

At the same time, the rise of deep learning (DL) concepts helps to effectively develop a COVID-19 diagnosis model to attain maximum detection rate with minimum computation time. This paper presents a new Residual Network (ResNet) based Class Attention Layer with Bidirectional LSTM called RCAL-BiLSTM for COVID-19 Diagnosis. The proposed RCAL-BiLSTM model involves a series of processes namely bilateral filtering (BF) based preprocessing, RCAL-BiLSTM based feature extraction, and softmax (SM) based classification. Once the BF technique produces the preprocessed image, RCAL-BiLSTM based feature extraction process takes place using three modules, namely ResNet based feature extraction, CAL, and Bi-LSTM modules. Finally, the SM layer is applied to categorize the feature vectors into corresponding feature maps. The experimental validation of the presented RCAL-BiLSTM model is tested against Chest-X-Ray dataset and the results are determined under several aspects. The experimental outcome pointed out the superior nature of the RCAL-BiLSTM model by attaining maximum sensitivity of 93.28%, specificity of 94.61%, precision of 94.90%, accuracy of 94.88%, F-score of 93.10% and kappa value of 91.40%. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,0,"Department of Logistics, State University of Management, Moscow, Russian Federation; Department of Entrepreneurship and Logistics, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation; Information Center, University of Natural Science, Ho Chi Minh city, Viet Nam; Faculty of Information Technology, Duy Tan University, Da Nang, Viet Nam; Graduate School, Duy Tan University, Da Nang, Viet Nam; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Computer Applications, Alagappa University, Karaikudi, India","Chest-X-Ray; COVID-19; deep learning; feature extraction; machine learning","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,"","Journal of Applied Statistics",12119,"journal",0.528,"Q3",52,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","1970-1971, 1973-2020","Statistics and Probability (Q3); Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty (Q3)","6028cad343ed5c61b9dc54ab0e42eeada82307a3",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096611194",7,57216204469,"Pustokhin D.",48,38,6,4,2,38,60014775,"State University of Management, Moscow","rus","Russian Federation",NULL,56884031900,"Shankar K.",1498,787,2,23,7,361,60016712,"Alagappa University","ind","India","TN",4,3,3,1.60,114,"2021-02-26","2020-11-25","2020-11-23",0,6,0,1.6,1.6,1.35,"2020-11-25","2020-11-25","2020-11-25",29,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02664763.2020.1849057",3

An automatic disease detection framework assists doctors in the diagnosis of disease and provides exact, consistent, and fast results and reduces the death rate. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become one of the most severe and acute diseases in recent times and has spread globally. Therefore, an automated detection system, as the fastest diagnostic option, should be implemented to impede COVID-19 from spreading. This paper aims to introduce a deep learning technique based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to diagnose COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images. In this system, CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. A collection of 4575 X-ray images, including 1525 images of COVID-19, were used as a dataset in this system. The experimental results show that our proposed system achieved an accuracy of 99.4%, AUC of 99.9%, specificity of 99.2%, sensitivity of 99.3%, and F1-score of 98.9%. The system achieved desired results on the currently available dataset, which can be further improved when more COVID-19 images become available.

Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,20,"Radiology Department, Hospital of Wuhan Red Cross Society, Wuhan, 430015, China; Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom; Aladdin Healthcare Technologies Ltd., London, EC1Y 0UH, United Kingdom; Hangzhou Ocean's Smart Boya Company, Ltd., Hangzhou, 310016, China; Mind Rank Ltd., Admiralty, Hong Kong; Department of Clinical Molecular Biology, University of Oslo, Oslo, 0315, Norway; Radiology Department, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, Shenzhen, 518035, China; PET-CT Center, Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China; NHLI, Imperial College London, London, SW3 6LY, United Kingdom; Royal Brompton Hospital, London, SW3 6NP, United Kingdom","classification; convolutional neural network; COVID-19; CT~images; deep learning; weakly supervision","Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Image classification; Polymerase chain reaction; Clinical decision; Clinical diagnosis; Diagnosis and prognosis; Laboratory testing; Learning strategy; Respiratory failure; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Testing resources; Deep learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,"","IEEE Access",21100374601,"journal",0.775,"Q1",86,"United States","Northern America","2013-2020","Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Engineering (miscellaneous) (Q1); Materials Science (miscellaneous) (Q2)","003d2e515e1aaf06f0052769953e861ed8e56608",55,0,2,1,1,"2-s2.0-85088288071",12,57216772263,"Hu S.",44,44,2,4,2,35,117895291,"Wuhan Red Cross Hospital","chn","China","Hubei",55584800628,"Yang G.",1185,881,70,16,10,238,60009009,"Royal Brompton Hospital","gbr","United Kingdom",NULL,9,NULL,7,49.00,1875,"2020-07-28","2020-07-20","2019-12-31",0,126,0,49,0,0,"2020-06-29","2021-03-10","2020-9-3",37,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09127422.pdf?arnumber=9127422",8

This is due to a large amount of complicated knowledge, such as hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions, and bonding with hydrogen. In this paper, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to build drug-target interaction prediction model to predict drug-target interactions. Bat Algorithm (BA) is used in this paper to optimize the model parameters of RNN (RNN-BA) and then using the corona virus as a target. The drug with the best binding affinity will be a potential cure for the virus. The proposed model consists of different four phases; data preparation phase, hyper-parameters optimizing phase, learning phase and fine-tuning for specific ligand subsets. The used dataset in this paper to train and evaluate the proposed model is selected from a total of 677,044 SMILES. The experimental results of the proposed model showed high level of performance in comparison with the related approaches. © 2020, Success Culture Press.

However, DNN classifiers trained on known diseases usually fail when they confront new diseases such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework and pipeline for explainable medical imaging that can classify known diseases as well as detect new/unknown diseases when the models are only trained on known disease images. We first provide in-depth mathematical analysis to explain the overconfidence phenomena and present the calibrated confidence that can mitigate the overconfidence. Using calibrated confidence, we design a decision engine to determine if a medical image belongs to some known diseases or a new disease. At last, we introduce a new visual explanation to further reveal the suspected region inside each image. Using both Skin Lesion and Chest X-Ray datasets, we validate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of new disease discovery, i.e., distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia without seeing any COVID-19 data during training. We also qualitatively show that our visual explanations are highly consistent with doctors’ ground truth. While our work was not designed to target COVID-19, our experimental validation using the real world COVID-19 cases/data demonstrates the general applicability of our pipeline for different diseases based on medical imaging. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,0,"Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA, United States","COVID-19; DNN confidence calibration; New/unknown disease discovery; Visual explanation","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image analysis; Image understanding; Medical imaging; Pipelines; Chest x-rays; Decision engines; Experimental validations; Ground truth; Large amounts; Learning frameworks; Mathematical analysis; Skin lesion; Diagnosis","Springer","Springer","English","Conference Paper","Final","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,"","Communications in Computer and Information Science",17700155007,"book series",0.188,"Q3",45,"Germany","Western Europe","2007-2020","Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q3); Mathematics (miscellaneous) (Q4)","a5a93b8f51aee3108e3aad26766b6d519e667853",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85088557029",1,57218282810,"Tang C.",0,0,1,0,1,0,106249337,"Lynbrook High School","usa","United States","CA",57218282810,"Tang C.",0,0,1,0,1,0,106249337,"Lynbrook High School","usa","United States","CA",1,1,1,0.50,120,"2020-07-15","2020-07-09","2020-07-07",0,8,0,0.5,0,0,"2020-07-07","2020-07-08","2020-7-8",17,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-52791-4_27",7

Due to COVID-19's spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches toward the best responses in practical applications. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,25,"Department of Electromechanical Engineering and Power Electronics (KEV), University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, Pilsen, 301 00, Czech Republic; School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW  2109, Australia; Regional Innovation Centre for Electrical Engineering (RICE), University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, Pilsen, 301 00, Czech Republic; Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1416753955, Iran; Department of English Language and Literature, Razi University, Kermanshah, 6714414971, Iran; Young Researchers and Elite Club, Kermanshah Branch, Islamic Azad University, Kermanshah, 1477893855, Iran; School of Engineering and the Built Environment, Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh, EH11 4DY, United Kingdom; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI  53706, United States; Physics and Astronomy Department, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA  70803, United States; Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, Kingsville, TX  78363, United States; Department of Electrical Engineering, Kermanshah Branch, Islamic Azad University, Kermanshah, 1477893855, Iran; Edward S.

Owing to its rapidly spreading existence and high death count, the WHO has classified it as a pandemic. Biomedical engineers, virologists, epidemiologists, and people from other medical fields are working to help contain this epidemic as soon as possible. The virus incubates for five days in the human body and then begins displaying symptoms, in some cases, as late as 27 days. In some instances, CT scan based diagnosis has been found to have better sensitivity than RT-PCR, which is currently the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Lung conditions relevant to COVID-19 in CT scans are ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and pleural effusion. In this paper, two segmentation tasks are performed to predict lung spaces (segregated from ribcage and flesh in Chest CT) and COVID-19 anomalies from chest CT scans. A 2D deep learning architecture with U-Net as its backbone is proposed to solve both the segmentation tasks. It is observed that change in hyperparameters such as number of filters in down and up sampling layers, addition of attention gates, addition of spatial pyramid pooling as basic block and maintaining the homogeneity of 32 filters after each down-sampling block resulted in a good performance. The proposed approach is assessed using publically available datasets from GitHub and Kaggle. Model performance is evaluated in terms of F1-Score, Mean intersection over union (Mean IoU). It is noted that the proposed approach results in 97.31% of F1-Score and 84.6% of Mean IoU. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach using U-Net architecture as backbone with the changes in hyperparameters shows better results in comparison to existing U-Net architecture and attention U-net architecture. The study also recommends how this methodology can be integrated into the workflow of healthcare systems to help control the spread of COVID-19. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,0,"BML Munjal University, Kapriwas, India; IIT, Delhi, New Delhi, India; MAHE MIT University, Manipal, India; RayEye, Bengaluru, India","Computed Tomography; Consolidation; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Diagnosis; Ground Glass Opacities (GGO); Hyperparameters; Pleural Effusion; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Semantic Segmentation; Spatial pyramid pooling; U-Net architecture","Biological organs; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Signal sampling; Viruses; Ground-glass opacity; Health-care system; Hyperparameters; Learning architectures; Model performance; NET architecture; Pleural effusion; Spatial pyramids; Computerized tomography","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green","Diagnosis, Prognosis",33192159,"Multimedia Tools and Applications",25627,"journal",0.462,"Q1",59,"Netherlands","Western Europe","1995-2020","Media Technology (Q1); Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q2); Software (Q2)","8194ab1393e36ef19892e133e7fe0a1269bead78",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096100134",6,57219930711,"Kuchana M.",0,0,2,0,1,7,60113949,"BML Munjal University","ind","India","HR",54787827500,"Khatter K.",48,41,15,4,11,9,60113949,"BML Munjal University","ind","India","HR",1,1,1,0.25,345,"2020-11-17","2020-11-17","2020-11-07",0,23,0,0.25,0.25,0,"2020-11-08","2021-03-03","2021-3-1",27,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11042-020-10010-8.pdf",3

Chest computed tomography (CT)-based evaluation of pneumonia may indicate a need for isolation. Therefore, this radiologic modality plays an important role in managing patients with suspected COVID-19. Meanwhile, deep learning (DL) technology has been successful in detecting various imaging features of chest CT. This study applied a novel DL technique to standardize the discharge criteria of COVID-19 patients with consecutive negative respiratory pathogen nucleic acid test results at a “square cabin” hospital. Patients and Methods: DL was used to evaluate the chest CT scans of 270 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who had two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests (sampling interval >1 day). The CT scans evaluated were obtained after the patients’ second negative test result. The standard criterion determined by DL for patient discharge was a total volume ratio of lesion to lung <50%. Results: The mean number of days between hospitalization and DL was 14.3 (± 2.4). The average intersection over union was 0.7894. Two hundred and thirteen (78.9%) patients exhibited pneumonia, of whom 54.0% (115/213) had mild interstitial fibrosis. Twenty-one, 33, and 4 cases exhibited vascular enlargement, pleural thickening, and mediastinal lympha-denopathy, respectively. Of the latter, 18.8% (40/213) had a total volume ratio of lesions to lung ≥50% according to our severity scale and were monitored continuously in the hospital. Three cases had a positive follow-up nucleic acid test during hospitalization. None of the 230 discharged cases later tested positive or exhibited pneumonia progression. Conclusion: The novel DL enables the accurate management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and can help avoid cluster transmission or exacerbation in patients with false-negative acid test. © 2020 Meng et al.",2020,0,"Department of Radiology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Yizhun Medical AI Co.

One of the significant challenges in this crisis is to identify and monitor the COVID-19 patients quickly and efficiently to facilitate timely decisions for their treatment, monitoring, and management. Research efforts are on to develop less time-consuming methods to replace or to supplement RT-PCR-based methods. The present study is aimed at creating efficient deep learning models, trained with chest X-ray images, for rapid screening of COVID-19 patients. We used publicly available PA chest X-ray images of adult COVID-19 patients for the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based classification models for COVID-19 and other major infectious diseases. To increase the dataset size and develop generalized models, we performed 25 different types of augmentations on the original images. Furthermore, we utilized the transfer learning approach for the training and testing of the classification models. The combination of two best-performing models (each trained on 286 images, rotated through 120° or 140° angle) displayed the highest prediction accuracy for normal, COVID-19, non-COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis images. AI-based classification models trained through the transfer learning approach can efficiently classify the chest X-ray images representing studied diseases. Our method is more efficient than previously published methods.

Coronavirus was flown in-December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei region in China. Currently, the situation is enlarged by the infection in more than 200 countries all over the world. In this situation it was rising into huge forms in Bangladesh too. Modulated with a public dataset delivered by the IEDCR health authority, we have produced a sustainable prognostic method of COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh using a deep learning model. Throughout the research, we forecasted up to 30 days in which per day actual prediction was confirmed, death and recoveries number of people. Furthermore, we illustrated that long short-Term memory (LSTM) demands the actual output trends among time series data analysis with a controversial study that exceeds random forest (RF) regression and support vector regression (SVR), which both are machine learning (ML) models. The current COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh has been considered in this paper.

The urban rail transit is an important part of public transport in large cities with characteristic of intensive passengers and confined space, which is easy to become viral infection intermediary. In order to prevent and control the situation of the epidemic, the police's public security department for urban rail transit and the urban rail transit operation company have established a three-layer filter network, which is composed of safety inspection, patrol and temporary interrogation, and intelligent police service, and this network implements the deep learning technology to identify key persons, prohibited luggage, and the body temperature of passengers. For the problem of uncertainty in total passenger flow and its density, this paper proposes a method for re-establishing the passenger flow model to focus on data monitoring, and resetting the threshold value of alarm to control the passenger density. In view of the difficulty of passenger identification caused by mask during the epidemic, this paper proposes a systematic schema of timely adjusting face recognition algorithm, modifying the alarm threshold, using iris recognition system, carrying out information collision comparison, deep mining and intelligent judging, which discover the high-risk groups of epidemic prevention and control in time. China's police's public security department for urban rail transit aims at prevention of virus input, infection, riot, fake new, scientific prevention and control, and has made precise policy implementation to hold urban rail transit's covid-19 intelligent prevention and control work, finally won the battle and effectively guaranteed the people's life safety and health. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Today, around 215 countries are affected by COVID-19 disease. WHO announced approximately number of cases 11,274,600 worldwide. Due to rapidly rising cases daily in the hospitals, there are a limited number of resources available to control COVID-19 disease. Therefore, it is essential to develop an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients is important for preventing the disease from spreading to others. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning based approach that can differentiate COVID- 19 disease patients from viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and healthy (normal) cases. In this approach, deep transfer learning is adopted. We used binary and multi-class dataset which is categorized in four types for experimentation: (i) Collection of 728 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed COVID-19 disease and 504 normal condition images (ii) Collection of 1428 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed COVID-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia, and 504 normal condition images. (iii) Collections of 1442 X- ray images including 224 images with confirmed COVID-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions (iv) Collections of 5232 X- ray images including 2358 images with confirmed bacterial and 1345 with viral pneumonia, and 1346 images of normal conditions. In this paper, we have used nine convolutional neural network based architecture (AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet-50, Se-ResNet-50, DenseNet121, Inception V4, Inception ResNet V2, ResNeXt-50, and Se-ResNeXt-50). Experimental results indicate that the pre trained model Se-ResNeXt-50 achieves the highest classification accuracy of 99.32% for binary class and 97.55% for multi-class among all pre-trained models. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,2,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management, Nagpur, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation, Deemed to be University, Hyderabad, Telangana  500075, India; Student of Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 N.

Many radiological findings have shown that X-ray and CT imaging scans are an effective solution to assess disease severity during the early stage of COVID-19. Many artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis works have rapidly been proposed to focus on solving this classification problem and determine whether a patient is infected with COVID-19. Most of these works have designed networks and applied a single CT image to perform classification; however, this approach ignores prior information such as the patient’s clinical symptoms. Second, making a more specific diagnosis of clinical severity, such as slight or severe, is worthy of attention and is conducive to determining better follow-up treatments. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) based dual-tasks network, named FaNet, that can perform rapid both diagnosis and severity assessments for COVID-19 based on the combination of 3D CT imaging and clinical symptoms. Generally, 3D CT image sequences provide more spatial information than do single CT images. In addition, the clinical symptoms can be considered as prior information to improve the assessment accuracy; these symptoms are typically quickly and easily accessible to radiologists. Therefore, we designed a network that considers both CT image information and existing clinical symptom information and conducted experiments on 416 patient data, including 207 normal chest CT cases and 209 COVID-19 confirmed ones. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional symptom prior information as well as the network architecture designing. The proposed FaNet achieved an accuracy of 98.28% on diagnosis assessment and 94.83% on severity assessment for test datasets. In the future, we will collect more covid-CT patient data and seek further improvement. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,0,"Lauterbur Research Center for Biomedical Imaging, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, 518055, China; Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Health Informatics, Shenzhen, 518055, China; Department of Radiology, Guizhou Provincial People’s Hospital, Guiyang, 550002, China; Department of Radiology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011, China","3D CT image sequences; Clinical symptoms; COVID-19; Fast assessment network","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Deep learning; Hospital data processing; Network architecture; Assessment accuracy; Clinical symptoms; Disease severity; Effective solution; Prior information; Radiological findings; Spatial informations; Specific diagnosis; Computerized tomography","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,NULL,"Applied Intelligence",23674,"journal",0.726,"Q2",58,"Netherlands","Western Europe","1991-2020","Artificial Intelligence (Q2)","56689b29f75a8e7a7174a9d8ca18d4bfeb09a432",1,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096041534",11,57221145440,"Huang Z.",0,0,1,0,1,10,60019499,"Chinese Academy of Sciences","chn","China","Beijing",24824532900,"Hu Z.",298,211,71,10,14,114,60102083,"Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology","chn","China",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-11-14","2020-11-14","2020-11-14",55,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10489-020-01965-0.pdf",3

The urgent need for such diagnostic systems is recommended by experts in order to achieve the mass and targeted SARS-CoV-2 detection required to manage the COVID-19 pandemic through the understanding of infection progression and timely therapy decisions. To achieve these tasks, there is a scope for developing smart sensors to rapidly and selectively detect SARS-CoV-2 protein at the picomolar level. COVID-19 infection, due to human-to-human transmission, demands diagnostics at the point-of-care (POC) without the need of experienced labor and sophisticated laboratories. Keeping the above-mentioned considerations, we propose to explore the compartmentalization approach by designing and developing nanoenabled miniaturized electrochemical biosensors to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus at the site of the epidemic as the best way to manage the pandemic. Such COVID-19 diagnostics approach based on a POC sensing technology can be interfaced with the Internet of things and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (such as machine learning and deep learning for diagnostics) for investigating useful informatics via data storage, sharing, and analytics. Keeping COVID-19 management related challenges and aspects under consideration, our work in this review presents a collective approach involving electrochemical SARS-CoV-2 biosensing supported by AI to generate the bioinformatics needed for early stage COVID-19 diagnosis, correlation of viral load with pathogenesis, understanding of pandemic progression, therapy optimization, POC diagnostics, and diseases management in a personalized manner. ©",2020,9,"NanoBioTech Laboratory, Department of Natural Sciences, Division of Sciences, Art, and Mathematics, Florida Polytechnic University, Lakeland, FL  33805, United States; Molecule Inc., Tampa, FL  33612, United States; Applied AI Research Lab, University of Houston Victoria, Victoria, TX  77901, United States; Mads Clausen Institute, NanoSYD, University of Southern Denmark, Alsion 2, Sønderborg, 6400, Denmark; National Center for NanoBioElectronics, Brain Mapping Foundation, Brain Technology and Innovation Park, Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics, Pacific Palisades, CA  90272, United States; RFIC Bio Center, Department of Electronics Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, 01897, South Korea; Clean Energy Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL  33620, United States","artificial intelligence; COVID-19 pandemic; diseases management; infectious diseases; Internet of things; point-of-care; smart diagnostics; smart sensing","Bioinformatics; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Disease control; Proteins; Viruses; Coronaviruses; Diagnostic systems; Electrochemical biosensor; Human-to-human transmission; Picomolar levels; Sensing technology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Virus proteins; Diseases","American Chemical Society","American Chemical Society","English","Review","Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",NULL,"","ACS Applied Bio Materials",21100912215,"journal",0.657,"Q2",9,"United States","Northern America","2018-2020","Biochemistry (medical) (Q2); Biomaterials (Q2); Biomedical Engineering (Q2); Chemistry (miscellaneous) (Q2)","5c30a8a988f44bf688555d21d28f25bab8e3f7c0",9,0,1,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096015876",7,24080061400,"Kaushik A.",5504,3992,8,42,15,349,60110852,"Florida Polytechnic University","usa","United States","FL",57219709023,"Goswami D.",9,9,3,1,7,11,60007740,"University of South Florida, Tampa","usa","United States","FL",9,6,8,21.25,1207,"2021-02-02","2020-10-28","2020-10-26",0,71,0,21.25,21.25,1.5,"2020-10-27","2021-02-26","2020-11-16",95,"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsabm.0c01004",4

However, RT-PCR kits are costly and take 6-9 hours to confirm infection in the patient. Due to less sensitivity of RT-PCR, it provides high false-negative results. To resolve this problem, radiological imaging techniques such as chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) are used to detect and diagnose COVID-19. In this paper, chest X-rays is preferred over CT scan. The reason behind this is that X-rays machines are available in most of the hospitals. X-rays machines are cheaper than the CT scan machine. Besides this, X-rays has low ionizing radiations than CT scan. COVID-19 reveals some radiological signatures that can be easily detected through chest X-rays. For this, radiologists are required to analyze these signatures. However, it is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Hence, there is a need to automate the analysis of chest X-rays. The automatic analysis of chest X-rays can be done through deep learning-based approaches, which may accelerate the analysis time. These approaches can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine-tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. However, these approaches applied to chest X-rays are very limited. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to develop an automated deep transfer learning-based approach for detection of COVID-19 infection in chest X-rays by using the extreme version of the Inception (Xception) model. Extensive comparative analyses show that the proposed model performs significantly better as compared to the existing models. © 2020 AGBM",2020,19,"Department of Information Technology, School of Computing and Information Technology, Manipal University Jaipur, Jaipur, Rajasthan  303007, India; Department Of Computer Science and Engineering, Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology, Janakpuri, New Delhi  110058, India; Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, School of Computing and Information Technology, Manipal University Jaipur, Jaipur, Rajasthan  303007, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh  177005, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Computing and Information Technology, Manipal University Jaipur, Jaipur, Rajasthan  303007, India","Chest x-ray; COVID-19; Deep learning; Transfer learning","","Elsevier Masson SAS","Elsevier","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",NULL,NULL,"IRBM",12300154908,"journal",0.286,"Q3",26,"France","Western Europe","2007-2020","Biomedical Engineering (Q3); Biophysics (Q3)","98a52fc7a7b0dec567b107140f2d72d6c4c76d80",27,0,1,1,1,"2-s2.0-85087700433",5,57208597247,"Das N.",33,32,1,2,9,13,60108737,"Manipal University Jaipur","ind","India","RJ",57195923799,"Singh D.",737,302,1,20,10,46,60121496,"Bennett University","ind","India","UP",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-07-03","2021-01-08","2020-7-9",48,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1959031820301172?httpAccept=text/xml",7

A model for measuring and preventing the continued spread of COVID-19 is urgently required to provide smart health care services. This requires using advanced intelligent computing such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive computing, cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. This paper proposes a model for predicting COVID-19 using the SIR and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of the citizens of KSA. Knowing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases each day is critical for mathematical modeling to be able to identify the behavioral effects of the pandemic. It forecasts the situation for the upcoming 700 days. The proposed system predicts whether COVID-19 will spread in the population or die out in the long run. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak and its possible end for three types of scenarios: ""no actions,""""lockdown,""and ""new medicines.""The effect of interventions like lockdown and new medicines is compared with the ""no actions""scenario. The lockdown case delays the peak point by decreasing the infection and affects the area equality rule of the infected curves. On the other side, new medicines have a significant impact on infected curve by decreasing the number of infected people about time. Available forecast data on COVID-19 using simulations predict that the highest level of cases might occur between 15 and 30 November 2020. Simulation data suggest that the virus might be fully under control only after June 2021. The reproductive rate shows that measures such as government lockdowns and isolation of individuals are not enough to stop the pandemic. This study recommends that authorities should, as soon as possible, apply a strict long-term containment strategy to reduce the epidemic size successfully. © 2020 Saad Awadh Alanazi et al.",2020,0,"Department of Computer Science, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Jouf University, Sakakah, Saudi Arabia; Department of Computer Engineering and Networks, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Jouf University, Sakakah, Saudi Arabia; Department of Computer Engineering, College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, P.O.

The secondary aim of the study was to compare the radiologic findings with clinical and laboratory data. METHODS Patients with COVID-19 who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) between March 11, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical and laboratory findings of patients with abnormal findings on chest CT and PCR-evidence of COVID-19 infection were record-ed. Visual quantitative assessment score (VQAS) was performed according to the extent of lung opacities. Software-based quantitative assessment of the normal lung parenchyma percentage (SQNLP) was automatically quantified by a deep learning software. The presence of consolidation and crazy paving pattern (CPP) was also recorded. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation between quantitative radiologic assessments, and clinical and laboratory findings, as well as to determine the predictive utility of radiologic findings for estimating severe pneumonia and admission to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS A total of 90 patients were enrolled. Both VQAS and SQNLP were significantly correlated with multiple clinical parameters. While VQAS >8.5 (sensitivity, 84.2%; specificity, 80.3%) and SQNLP <82.45% (sensitivity, 83.1%; specificity, 84.2%) were related to severe pneumonia, VQAS >9.5 (sensitivity, 93.3%; specificity, 86.5%) and SQNLP <81.1% (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 86.7%) were predictive of ICU admission. Both consolidation and CPP were more commonly seen in patients with severe pneumonia than patients with nonsevere pneumonia (P = 0.197 for con-solidation; P < 0.001 for CPP). Moreover, the presence of CPP showed high specificity (97.2%) for severe pneumonia. CONCLUSION Both SQNLP and VQAS were significantly related to the clinical findings, highlighting their clinical utility in predicting severe pneumonia, ICU admission, length of hospital stay, and management of the disease. On the other hand, presence of CPP has high specificity for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. © Turkish Society of Radiology 2020.",2020,1,"Departments of Radiology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey; Departments of Radiology Pulmonary Medicine, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey; Intensive Care, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Intensive Care, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey; Departments of Infectious Diseases, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey","","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; C reactive protein; creatinine; D dimer; ferritin; fibrinogen; lactate dehydrogenase; potassium; procalcitonin; sodium; troponin; adult; anosmia; Article; breathing rate; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; female; hospitalization; human; image reconstruction; intensive care unit; lung parenchyma; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; oxygen saturation; platelet count; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; predictive value; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; Betacoronavirus; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; evaluation study; lung; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Turkish Society of Radiology","Turkish Society of Radiology","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green",NULL,NULL,"Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology",144938,"journal",0.646,"Q2",41,"Turkey","Middle East","2005-2020","Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine (Q2); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q2)","fe3bc42cafc2b816dd8661de36b72f302afc7d0a",4,0,1,0,1,"2-s2.0-85096151944",11,54580821500,"Durhan G.",65,64,19,5,11,80,60011512,"Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine","tur","Turkey",NULL,6603332456,"Arıyürek O.",271,260,1,9,28,57,60020484,"Hacettepe Üniversitesi","tur","Turkey",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-09-02","2021-02-26","2020-11-5",0,"",5

Methods: This retrospective single-center study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) between February 25 and April 9, 2020, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Initial CXRs obtained on ED presentation were evaluated by a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) system and compared with the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score, calculated by two experienced radiologists. Death and critical COVID-19 (admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or deaths occurring before ICU admission) were identified as clinical outcomes. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes were evaluated by multivariate analyses. Results: Six hundred ninety-seven 697 patients were included in the study: 465 males (66.7%), median age of 62 years (IQR 52–75). Multivariate analyses adjusting for demographics and comorbidities showed that an AI system-based score ≥ 30 on the initial CXR was an independent predictor both for mortality (HR 2.60 (95% CI 1.69 − 3.99; p < 0.001)) and critical COVID-19 (HR 3.40 (95% CI 2.35–4.94; p < 0.001)). Other independent predictors were RALE score, older age, male sex, coronary artery disease, COPD, and neurodegenerative disease. Conclusion: AI- and radiologist-assessed disease severity scores on CXRs obtained on ED presentation were independent and comparable predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04318366 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04318366). Key Points: • AI system–based score ≥ 30 and a RALE score ≥ 12 at CXRs performed at ED presentation are independent and comparable predictors of death and/or ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. • Other independent predictors are older age, male sex, coronary artery disease, COPD, and neurodegenerative disease. • The comparable performance of the AI system in relation to a radiologist-assessed score in predicting adverse outcomes may represent a game-changer in resource-constrained settings. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,4,"Clinical and Experimental Radiology Unit, Experimental Imaging Center, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Via Olgettina 58, Milan, Italy; Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Unit of General Medicine and Advanced Care, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Prognosis; Radiography; Severe acute respiratory syndrome","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",NULL,32945968,"European Radiology",16687,"journal",1.579,"Q1",143,"Germany","Western Europe","1991-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q1); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q1)","529906d5a02fc7b25c3b68170e7e7807c4a272b5",6,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85091173108",14,56986321100,"Mushtaq J.",29,29,6,3,6,486,60082964,"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute","ita","Italy","MI",7003492338,"De Cobelli F.",7483,6710,1,43,29,1351,60082964,"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute","ita","Italy","MI",34,34,34,25.95,1513,"2020-12-04","2020-09-19","2020-09-17",0,89,0,25.95,25.95,0,"2020-09-18","2021-02-12","2021-2-12",22,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00330-020-07269-8.pdf",5

Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,13,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar; Thoracic Surgery, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar; Department of Biomedical Physics and Technology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, 1000, Bangladesh; Department of Mathematics and Physics, North South University, Dhaka, 1229, Bangladesh; Department of Orthodontics, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, 1000, Bangladesh; Department of Electrical Engineering (JC), University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, 25120, Pakistan; Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, 43600, Malaysia; Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, Intelligent Information Processing Laboratory, National Center for Artificial Intelligence, University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, 48550, Pakistan","Artificial intelligence; computer-aided diagnostic tool; COVID-19 pneumonia; machine learning; transfer learning; viral pneumonia","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Database systems; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Functional polymers; Polymerase chain reaction; Transfer learning; Automatic Detection; Classification accuracy; Computer aided diagnostics; Health care professionals; Learning techniques; Preventive measures; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Technological tools; Learning algorithms","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,NULL,"IEEE Access",21100374601,"journal",0.775,"Q1",86,"United States","Northern America","2013-2020","Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Engineering (miscellaneous) (Q1); Materials Science (miscellaneous) (Q2)","29bf7bd9c64e18a7b57b5da80e03fab1d9f1de2e",142,0,12,1,1,"2-s2.0-85089309357",12,8964151000,"Chowdhury M.",215,181,1,9,42,136,60072749,"Qatar University","qat","Qatar",NULL,57216237856,"Islam M.",54,43,3,4,2,101,60001821,"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia","mys","Malaysia","Selangor",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-07-20","2021-03-10","2020-10-21",73,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09144185.pdf?arnumber=9144185",7

The similarity of COVID-19 disease with other lung infections, along with its high spreading rate, makes the diagnosis difficult. Solutions based on machine learning techniques achieved relevant results in identifying the correct disease and providing early diagnosis, and can hence provide significant clinical decision support; however, such approaches suffer from the lack of proper means for interpreting the choices made by the models, especially in case of deep learning ones. With the aim to improve interpretability and explainability in the process of making qualified decisions, we designed a system that allows a partial opening of this black box by means of proper investigations on the rationale behind the decisions. We tested our approach over artificial neural networks trained for multiple classification based on Chest X-ray images; our tool analyzed the internal processes performed by the networks during the classification tasks to identify the most important elements involved in the training process that influence the network’s decisions.

In current investigation we introduce a new deep learning-based automatic segmentation model for localization of COVID-19 pulmonary lesions. Methods: A total of 2469 CT scan slices, containing 1402 manually segmented abnormal and 1067 normal slices form 55 COVID-19 patients and 41 healthy individuals, were used to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on Detectron2, an open-source modular object detection library. A dataset, including 1224 CT slices of 18 COVID-19 patients and 9 healthy individuals, was used to test the model. Results: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the trained model in marking a single image slice with COVID-19 lesion were 0.954, 0.928, and 0.961, respectively. Considering a threshold of 0.4% for percentage of lung involvement, the model was capable of diagnosing the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, with a sensitivity of 0.982% and a specificity of 88.5%. Furthermore, the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) index for the test dataset was 0.865. Conclusion: The deep learning-based automatic segmentation method provides an acceptable accuracy in delineation and localization of COVID-19 lesions, assisting the clinicians and researchers for quantification of abnormal findings in chest CT scans. Moreover, instance segmentation is capable of monitoring longitudinal changes of the lesions, which could be beneficial to patients’ follow-up.

The timely diagnosis of infected patients is a critical step to limit the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The chest radiography imaging has shown to be an effective screening technique in diagnosing the COVID-19 epidemic. To reduce the pressure on radiologists and control of the epidemic, fast and accurate a hybrid deep learning framework for diagnosing COVID-19 virus in chest X-ray images is developed and termed as the COVID-CheXNet system. First, the contrast of the X-ray image was enhanced and the noise level was reduced using the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and Butterworth bandpass filter, respectively. This was followed by fusing the results obtained from two different pre-trained deep learning models based on the incorporation of a ResNet34 and high-resolution network model trained using a large-scale dataset. Herein, the parallel architecture was considered, which provides radiologists with a high degree of confidence to discriminate between the healthy and COVID-19 infected people. The proposed COVID-CheXNet system has managed to correctly and accurately diagnose the COVID-19 patients with a detection accuracy rate of 99.99%, sensitivity of 99.98%, specificity of 100%, precision of 100%, F1-score of 99.99%, MSE of 0.011%, and RMSE of 0.012% using the weighted sum rule at the score-level. The efficiency and usefulness of the proposed COVID-CheXNet system are established along with the possibility of using it in real clinical centers for fast diagnosis and treatment supplement, with less than 2 s per image to get the prediction result. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,1,"Communications Engineering Techniques Department, Information Technology Collage, Imam Ja’afar Al-Sadiq University, Baghdad, Iraq; Computer Science Department, Al-Ma’aref University College, Anbar, Iraq; College of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Anbar, 11, Ramadi, Anbar, Iraq; College of Agriculture, Al-Muthanna University, Samawah, 66001, Iraq; Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Johor  86400, Malaysia; Software Engineering Department, College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia; School of Computer Science, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China; eVIDA Lab, The University of Deusto, Avda/Universidades 24, Bilbao, 48007, Spain","Chest radiography imaging; Chest X-ray images; Coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic; Deep learning; ResNet34 model; Transfer learning","Bandpass filters; Butterworth filters; Diagnosis; Disease control; Image enhancement; Large dataset; Learning systems; Parallel architectures; Viruses; X ray radiography; Adaptive histogram equalization; Chest radiography; Degree of confidence; Detection accuracy; Infected patients; Large-scale dataset; Learning frameworks; Screening techniques; Deep learning","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green","Diagnosis, Prognosis",NULL,"Soft Computing",28554,"journal",0.705,"Q2",73,"Germany","Western Europe","2000, 2003-2020","Geometry and Topology (Q2); Software (Q2); Theoretical Computer Science (Q2)","7efb220b53f4bc968cf4203b4006e7c51d58ff95",2,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096375502",8,57188925513,"Al-Waisy A.",137,124,12,7,6,26,60071163,"University Of Anbar","irq","Iraq","Iraq",35732954700,"Garcia-Zapirain B.",2133,1981,12,19,14,534,60006565,"Universidad de Deusto","esp","Spain","Madrid",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-11-21","2021-01-13","2020-11-21",40,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00500-020-05424-3.pdf",3

The outbreak has caused shocking effects to the people across the globe. It is important to screen a majority of the population in every country and for the respective governments to take appropriate action. There is a need for a rapid screening system to triage and recommend the patients for appropriate treatment. Chest X-ray imaging is one of the potential modalities, which has ample advantages such as wide availability even in the villages, portability, fast data sharing option from the point of capturing to the point of investigation, etc. The aim of the proposed work is to develop a deep learning algorithm for screening COVID-19 cases by leveraging the widely available X-ray imaging. We have built a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network model utilizing a combination of the public domain (open-source COVID-19) and private data (pneumonia and normal cases). The dataset was used before and after the segmentation of the lung region for training and testing. The outcome of the classification after lung segmentation resulted in significant superiority. The average accuracy achieved by the proposed system was 96%. The heat maps incorporated in the system were helpful for our radiologists to cross-verify whether the appropriate features are identified. This system (COVID-Detect) can be used in remote places in the countries affected by COVID-19 for mass screening of suspected cases and suggesting appropriate actions, such as recommending confirmatory tests. © National Taiwan University.",2020,0,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rajalakshmi Engineering College Thandalam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu  602105, India; Department of Computer Science Engineering, Rajalakshmi Engineering College Thandalam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu  602105, India; Sentinel Radiology Solutions, Kilpauk, Chennai, Tamil Nadu  600010, India; Medical Devices and Healthcare Technologies Department, It Service Company, Bengaluru, Karnataka  560066, India; Centre for Medical Imaging, Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Thandalam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu  602105, India; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Centre for Medical Imaging, Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Thandalam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu  602105, India","Chest X-ray images; Coronavirus (COVID-19); Deep learning; Lung segmentation; Mass screening","Biological organs; Convolutional neural networks; Data Sharing; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Patient treatment; Statistical tests; Confirmatory test; Learning approach; Lung segmentation; Mass screenings; Public domains; Rapid screening system; Remote places; Training and testing; Deep learning","World Scientific","World Scientific","English","Article","Article in Press","",NULL,NULL,"Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications",92049,"journal",0.192,"Q4",21,"Singapore","Asiatic Region","1992-2020","Bioengineering (Q4); Biomedical Engineering (Q4); Biophysics (Q4)","a99b8ca0103edce24840cc150def0385cb0edba1",0,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85099501927",6,57197224767,"Rajkumar S.",10,9,6,2,10,9,60100989,"Rajalakshmi Engineering College","ind","India","TN",56871126100,"Ashwin R.",2,2,5,1,6,18,60000414,"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani","ind","India","RJ",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-12-15","2020-12-15","2020-12-15",0,"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.4015/S1016237221500101",2

By leveraging edge computing with the 5G RAN, management of epidemic diseases such as COVID-19 can be conducted efficiently. Deploying a hierarchical edge computing architecture offers several benefits such as scalability, low latency, and privacy for the data and the training model, which enables analysis of COVID-19 by a local trusted edge server. However, existing deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial drawbacks: first, the training requires a large COVID-19 dataset on various dimensions, which is difficult for any local authority to manage. Second, the DL results require ethical approval and explanations from healthcare providers and other stakeholders in order to be accepted. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that supports COVID-19 diagnosis, leveraging the low-latency, high-bandwidth features of the 5G network at the edge. Our framework employs a distributed DL paradigm where each COVID-19 edge employs its own local DL framework and uses a three-phase reconciliation with the global DL framework. The local DL model runs on edge nodes while the global DL model runs on a cloud environment. The training of a local DL model is performed with the dataset available from the edge; it is applied to the global model after receiving approval from the subject matter experts at the edge. Our framework adds semantics to existing DL models so that human domain experts on COVID-19 can gain insight and semantic visualization of the key decision-making activities that take place within the deep learning ecosystem. We have implemented a subset of various COVID-19 scenarios using distributed DL at the edge and in the cloud. The test results are promising.

The coronavirus spread so quickly between people and approaches 100,000 people worldwide. In this consequence, it is very much essential to identify the infected people so that prevention of spread can be taken. In this paper, the deep feature plus support vector machine (SVM) based methodology is suggested for detection of coronavirus infected patient using X-ray images. For classification, SVM is used instead of deep learning based classifier, as the later one need a large dataset for training and validation. The deep features from the fully connected layer of CNN model are extracted and fed to SVM for classification purpose. The SVM classifies the corona affected X-ray images from others. The methodology consists of three categories of Xray images, i.e., COVID-19, pneumonia and normal. The method is beneficial for the medical practitioner to classify among the COVID-19 patient, pneumonia patient and healthy people. SVM is evaluated for detection of COVID-19 using the deep features of different 13 number of CNN models. The SVM produced the best results using the deep feature of ResNet50. The classification model, i.e. ResNet50 plus SVM achieved accuracy, sensitivity, FPR and F1 score of 95.33%,95.33%,2.33% and 95.34% respectively for detection of COVID-19 (ignoring SARS, MERS and ARDS). Again, the highest accuracy achieved by ResNet50 plus SVM is 98.66%. The result is based on the Xray images available in the repository of GitHub and Kaggle. As the data set is in hundreds, the classification based on SVM is more robust compared to the transfer learning approach. Also, a comparison analysis of other traditional classification method is carried out. The traditional methods are local binary patterns (LBP) plus SVM, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) plus SVM and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) plus SVM. In traditional image classification method, LBP plus SVM achieved 93.4% of accuracy. © 2020 International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.",2020,26,"Department of Electronics, Sambalpur University, Odisha, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Odisha, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sambalpur University Institute of Information Technology, Sambalpur University, Odisha, India; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Dr. C.

We aimed to investigate and characterize associations between clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Seventy-four patients with RT-PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic at presentation. All were retrospectively identified from 825 patients with chest CT scans and positive RT-PCR following exposure or travel risks in outbreak settings in Japan and China. CTs were obtained for every patient within a day of admission and were reviewed for infiltrate subtypes and percent with assistance from a deep learning tool. Correlations of clinical, laboratory, and imaging features were analyzed and comparisons were performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Forty-eight of 74 (65%) initially asymptomatic patients had CT infiltrates that pre-dated symptom onset by 3.8 days. The most common CT infiltrates were ground glass opacities (45/48; 94%) and consolidation (22/48; 46%). Patient body temperature (p < 0.01), CRP (p < 0.01), and KL-6 (p = 0.02) were associated with the presence of CT infiltrates. Infiltrate volume (p = 0.01), percent lung involvement (p = 0.01), and consolidation (p = 0.043) were associated with subsequent development of symptoms. Conclusions: COVID-19 CT infiltrates pre-dated symptoms in two-thirds of patients. Body temperature elevation and laboratory evaluations may identify asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 CT infiltrates at presentation, and the characteristics of CT infiltrates could help identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients who subsequently develop symptoms. The role of chest CT in COVID-19 may be illuminated by a better understanding of CT infiltrates in patients with early disease or SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Key Points: • Forty-eight of 74 (65%) pre-selected asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 had abnormal chest CT findings. • CT infiltrates pre-dated symptom onset by 3.8 days (range 1–5). • KL-6, CRP, and elevated body temperature identified patients with CT infiltrates. Higher infiltrate volume, percent lung involvement, and pulmonary consolidation identified patients who developed symptoms. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2020,0,"Center for Interventional Oncology, Radiology and Imaging Sciences, NIH Clinical Center and National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; Philips Research North America, Cambridge, MA, United States; Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; Clinical Research Directorate, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, United States; State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States; Nvidia Corporation, Bethesda, MD, United States; Department of Radiology, Xiangyang NO. 1 People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang, Hubei, China; Department of Radiology, Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy; Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano, Milan, Italy; Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; Hospital Epidemiology Service, NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD, United States; Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, Bethesda, MD, United States","Asymptomatic infections; Pneumonia; SARS-CoV; Virus shedding","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",NULL,33146796,"European Radiology",16687,"journal",1.579,"Q1",143,"Germany","Western Europe","1991-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q1); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q1)","e3b39daba07bcc9311a163e4e5e90389296bfc43",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85095119907",24,55750958900,"Varble N.",243,210,22,9,9,122,60016561,"Philips Research","nld","Netherlands",NULL,7401873523,"Wood B.",18112,12205,14,71,27,1338,60006577,"National Institutes of Health (NIH)","usa","United States","MD",8,8,8,4.65,153,"2020-12-06","2020-11-05","2020-11-03",0,28,0,4.65,4.65,0,"2020-11-04","2020-12-08","2020-12-8",37,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00330-020-07401-8.pdf",3

What has emerged is the need for finding an efficient, quick and accurate method to mitigate the overloading of radiologists' efforts to diagnose the suspected cases. This study presents the combination of deep learning of extracted features with the Q-deformed entropy handcrafted features for discriminating between COVID-19 coronavirus, pneumonia and healthy computed tomography (CT) lung scans. In this study, pre-processing is used to reduce the effect of intensity variations between CT slices. Then histogram thresholding is used to isolate the background of the CT lung scan. Each CT lung scan undergoes a feature extraction which involves deep learning and a Q-deformed entropy algorithm. The obtained features are classified using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network classifier. Subsequently, combining all extracted features significantly improves the performance of the LSTM network to precisely discriminate between COVID-19, pneumonia and healthy cases.

In this study, Coronavirus was detected using a deep learning model, which is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence. Our dataset consists of three classes namely: coronavirus, pneumonia, and normal X-ray imagery. In this study, the data classes were restructured using the Fuzzy Color technique as a preprocessing step and the images that were structured with the original images were stacked. In the next step, the stacked dataset was trained with deep learning models (MobileNetV2, SqueezeNet) and the feature sets obtained by the models were processed using the Social Mimic optimization method. Thereafter, efficient features were combined and classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The overall classification rate obtained with the proposed approach was 99.27%.

With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on “flattening the curve”. While medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity. Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and, particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is effective in performing a rapid and consistent Corona virus diagnosis that is primarily aimed at assisting clinicians in making accurate identification of the virus. © 2020 by the authors.

X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered. Methods: Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. Results: Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.

The spread started at the end of January 2020, and different countries used different approaches in terms of testing, sanitization, lock down and quarantine centres to control the spread of the virus. People are getting back to working and routine life activities with new normal standards of testing, sanitization, social distancing and lock down. People are regularly tested to identify those who are infected with COVID-19 and isolate them from general public. However, testing all people unnecessarily is an expensive operation in terms of resources usage. There must be an optimal policy to test only those who have higher chances of being COVID-19 positive. Similarly, sanitization is used for individuals and streets to disinfect people and places. However, sanitization is also an expensive operation in terms of resources, and it is not possible to disinfect each and every individual and street. Social separating or lock down or quarantine centres focuses are different methodologies that are utilised to control the human-to-human transmission of the infection and separate the individuals who are contaminated with COVID-19. However, lock down and quarantine centres are expensive operations in terms of resources as it disturbs the affairs of state and the growth of economy. At the same time, it negatively affects the quality of life of a society. It is also not possible to provide resources to all citizens by locking them inside homes or quarantine centres for infinite time. All these parameters are expensive in terms of resources and have an effect on controlling the spread of the virus, quality of life of human, resources and economy. In this article, a novel intelligent method based on reinforcement learning (RL) is built up that quantifies the unique levels of testing, disinfection and lock down alongside its impact on the spread of the infection, personal satisfaction or quality of life, resource use and economy. Different RL algorithms are actualized and agents are prepared with these algorithms to interact with the environment to gain proficiency with the best strategy. The examinations exhibit that deep learning–based algorithms, for example, DQN and DDPG are performing better than customary RL algorithms, for example, Q-Learning and SARSA. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020,0,"Institute of Computing, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Pakistan; Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, Northern University, Pakistan; Faculty of Computer and Information Technology, Al-Madinah International University, Malaysia; College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Department of Cyber Security, College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Faculty of Computer and Information Technology, Al-Madinah International University, Malaysia","COVID-19 prevention; policy learning; Reinforcement learning","Deep learning; Locks (fasteners); Quality control; Transmissions; Viruses; General publics; Human-to-human transmission; Infinite time; Intelligent method; Optimal policies; Quality of life; Resource use; Sanitization; Reinforcement learning","SAGE Publications Ltd","SAGE Publications","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,NULL,"Journal of Information Science",12813,"journal",0.669,"Q1",60,"United States","Northern America","1979-2020","Library and Information Sciences (Q1); Information Systems (Q2)","046affffcff4cace3805260d2dcf7dfd5e253950",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85091095168",5,57212105453,"Uddin M.",20,10,16,3,2,69,60070620,"Kohat University of Science and Technology (KUST)","pak","Pakistan",NULL,57202832862,"Alsolami E.",13,11,5,3,3,26,60108699,"University of Jeddah","sau","Saudi Arabia",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-09-17","2020-09-22","2020-9-17",39,"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0165551520959798",5

Within the scope of the study, the results were obtained using chest X-ray images directly in the training-test procedures and the sub-band images obtained by applying dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to the above-mentioned images. The same experiments were repeated using images obtained by applying local binary pattern (LBP) to the chest X-ray images. Within the scope of the study, four new result generation pipeline algorithms having been put forward additionally, it was ensured that the experimental results were combined and the success of the study was improved. In the experiments carried out in this study, the training sessions were carried out using the k-fold cross validation method. Here the k value was chosen as 23 for the first and second training-test data sets. Considering the average highest results of the experiments performed within the scope of the study, the values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the first training-test data set were 0,9947, 0,9800, 0,9843, 0,9881 and 0,9990 respectively; while for the second training-test data set, they were 0,9920, 0,9939, 0,9891, 0,9828 and 0,9991; respectively. Within the scope of the study, finally, all the images were combined and the training and testing processes were repeated for a total of 556 X-ray images comprising 150 Covid-19 images and 406 non-Covid-19 images, by applying 2-fold cross. In this context, the average highest values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and AUC for this last training-test data set were found to be 0,9760, 1,0000, 0,9906, 0,9823 and 0,9997; respectively. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,1,"Ministry of Health of Republic of Turkey, Ankara, Turkey; Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Konya Technical University, Konya, Turkey","Chest X-ray classification; Convolutional neural networks (CNN); Corona 2019; Covid-19; Deep learning; Dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT); Local binary pattern (LBP)","Binary trees; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Network architecture; Partial discharges; Pipelines; Statistical tests; Wavelet transforms; Artificial intelligence methods; Automatic classification; Classification results; Dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT); Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; K fold cross validations; Local binary patterns; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Image compression","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",NULL,NULL,"Applied Intelligence",23674,"journal",0.726,"Q2",58,"Netherlands","Western Europe","1991-2020","Artificial Intelligence (Q2)","aeb68972e65ebbf8193d57d820053abe3add2624",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85095417406",2,56567916500,"Yaşar H.",37,32,6,3,8,6,60079005,"T.C.

Corona virus, also known as COVID-19 was first originated in Wuhan, Hubei province in China around December 2019 and spread out all over the world within few weeks. Based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins university and Canadian health authority, we have developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak in Canada using state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models. In this novel research, we evaluated the key features to predict the trends and possible stopping time of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Canada and around the world. In this paper we presented the Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a deep learning approach to forecast the future COVID-19 cases. Based on the results of our Long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we predicted the possible ending point of this outbreak will be around June 2020. In addition to that, we compared transmission rates of Canada with Italy and USA. Here we also presented the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14th day predictions for 2 successive days.

According to a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner Society, computed tomography (CT) is a relevant screening tool due to its higher sensitivity for detecting early pneumonic changes. However, physicians are extremely occupied fighting COVID-19 in this era of worldwide crisis. Thus, it is crucial to accelerate the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tool to support physicians. Objective: We aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in CT images and differentiate it from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases. Methods: A simple 2D deep learning framework, named the fast-track COVID-19 classification network (FCONet), was developed to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia based on a single chest CT image. FCONet was developed by transfer learning using one of four state-of-the-art pretrained deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, or Xception) as a backbone. For training and testing of FCONet, we collected 3993 chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, other pneumonia, and nonpneumonia diseases from Wonkwang University Hospital, Chonnam National University Hospital, and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology public database. These CT images were split into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. For the testing data set, the diagnostic performance of the four pretrained FCONet models to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia was compared. In addition, we tested the FCONet models on an external testing data set extracted from embedded low-quality chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia in recently published papers. Results: Among the four pretrained models of FCONet, ResNet-50 showed excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 99.58%, specificity 100.00%, and accuracy 99.87%) and outperformed the other three pretrained models in the testing data set. In the additional external testing data set using low-quality CT images, the detection accuracy of the ResNet-50 model was the highest (96.97%), followed by Xception, Inception-v3, and VGG16 (90.71%, 89.38%, and 87.12%, respectively). Conclusions: FCONet, a simple 2D deep learning framework based on a single chest CT image, provides excellent diagnostic performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on our testing data set, the FCONet model based on ResNet-50 appears to be the best model, as it outperformed other FCONet models based on VGG16, Xception, and Inception-v3. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Results of the CBCs include amounts of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a unit blood sample. It is possible to diagnose diseases such as anemia when the numbers or shapes of red blood cells become abnormal. The percentage of white blood cells is one of the important indicators of many severe illnesses such as infection and cancer. The amounts of platelets are decreased when the patient suffers hemophilia. Doctors often use these as criteria to monitor the general health conditions and recovery stages of the patients in the hospital. However, many hospitals are relying on expensive hematology analyzers to perform these tests, and these procedures are often time consuming. There is a huge demand for an automated, fast and easily used CBCs method in order to avoid redundant procedures and minimize patients' burden on costs of healthcare. In this research, we investigate a new CBC detection method by using deep neural networks, and discuss state of the art machine learning methods in order to meet the medical usage requirements. The approach we applied in this work is based on YOLOv3 algorithm, and our experimental results show the applied deep learning algorithms have a great potential for CBCs tests, promising for deployment of deep learning methods into microfluidic point-of-care medical devices.

In this article, we propose a clinical decision support system for the early detection of COVID 19 using deep learning based on chest radiographic images. For this we will develop an in-depth learning method which could extract the graphical characteristics of COVID-19 in order to provide a clinical diagnosis before the test of the pathogen. For this, we collected 100 images of cases of COVID-19 confirmed by pathogens, 100 images diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia and 100 images of normal cases. The architecture of the proposed model first goes through a preprocessing of the input images followed by an increase in data. Then the model begins a step to extract the characteristics followed by the learning step. Finally, the model begins a classification and prediction process with a fully connected network formed of several classifiers. Deep learning and classification were carried out using the VGG convolutional neural network. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 92.5% in internal validation and 87.5% in external validation. For the AUC criterion we obtained a value of 97% in internal validation and 95% in external validation. Regarding the sensitivity criterion, we obtained a value of 92% in internal validation and 87% in external validation.

Many studies have dealt with the prediction of the evolution of cases affected by the C'OVID-19 virus. Given the unreliability of the data collected about the number of new cases and the uncertainties in values, the results found cannot be accurate and present a bias. In this paper, we will present a study using artificial intelligence algorithms more precisely machine and deep learning algorithms to predict the evolution of cases reached by COVID-19 in the future given the application of confinement and the use of protection tools. To improve the accuracy of the results and to take into account the uncertain aspect of the data we will apply the theory of belief functions. Among objectives of this theory is the fusion of different sources of information, given by artificial intelligence algorithms in our case, in order to obtain a global knowledge in the form of a more precise and reinforced belief function. Results shows that applying the home isolation and the use of protection tools with the rate over of 80% can reduce considerably the number of cases. © 2020 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

Secondly, a dataset including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. The data was collected from the available X-ray images on public medical repositories. The results suggest that Deep Learning with X-ray imaging may extract significant biomarkers related to the Covid-19 disease, while the best accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained is 96.78%, 98.66%, and 96.46% respectively. Since by now, all diagnostic tests show failure rates such as to raise concerns, the probability of incorporating X-rays into the diagnosis of the disease could be assessed by the medical community, based on the findings, while more research to evaluate the X-ray approach from different aspects may be conducted. © 2020, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.",2020,191,"Department of Medical Physics, School of Medicine, University of Patras, Patras, 26504, Greece; Computer Technology Institute, University of Patras, Patras, Greece","Automatic detections; Covid-19; Deep learning; Transfer learning; X-ray","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Failure analysis; Network architecture; Transfer learning; Automatic Detection; Coronaviruses; Diagnostic tests; Failure rate; Image datasets; Medical community; Normal condition; State of the art; Medical imaging; Article; automation; bacterial pneumonia; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; human; image analysis; imaging; sensitivity and specificity; virus detection; virus pneumonia; X ray; Betacoronavirus; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; factual database; pandemic; procedures; thorax radiography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Bacterial; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiography, Thoracic","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",NULL,32524445,"Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine",28047,"journal",0.312,"Q3",28,"Netherlands","Western Europe","1983-2020","Biomedical Engineering (Q3); Biophysics (Q3); Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous) (Q3); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q3)","770b665c6941f8ae96cc7ef4ec434b059108bdac",350,0,34,1,1,"2-s2.0-85085243118",2,57195641603,"Apostolopoulos I.",213,202,12,3,4,7,60031155,"Panepistimion Patron","grc","Greece","Achaia",57217113354,"Mpesiana T.",191,191,1,1,1,1,60031155,"Panepistimion Patron","grc","Greece","Achaia",23,11,11,3.35,9930,"2020-10-30","2020-06-20","2020-04-02",0,669,0,3.35,3.1,0,"2020-04-03","2021-03-10","2020-6-10",17,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13246-020-00865-4.pdf",10

Disinfection and hygiene are two integral parts of any safe indoor environment, and these factors become more critical in COVID-19-like pandemic situations. Door handles are highly sensitive contact points that are prone to be contamination. Automation of the door-handle cleaning task is not only important for ensuring safety, but also to improve efficiency. This work proposes an AI-enabled framework for automating cleaning tasks through a Human Support Robot (HSR). The overall cleaning process involves mobile base motion, door-handle detection, and control of the HSR manipulator for the completion of the cleaning tasks. The detection part exploits a deep-learning technique to classify the image space, and provides a set of coordinates for the robot. The cooperative control between the spraying and wiping is developed in the Robotic Operating System. The control module uses the information obtained from the detection module to generate a task/operational space for the robot, along with evaluating the desired position to actuate the manipulators. The complete strategy is validated through numerical simulations, and experiments on a Toyota HSR platform. © 2020 by the authors.

This disease has spread to almost all countries in a short time. Countries take a series of stringent measures, including the prohibition of going out to prevent the virus that spreads COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we aimed to diagnose COVID-19 disease from X_RAY images by using deep learning architectures. In addition, 96.30% accuracy rate has been achieved with the hybrid architecture we have improved. While developing the hybrid model, the last 5 layers of Resnet 50 architecture were ejected. 10 layers were added in place of the 5 layers that were removed. The count of layers, which is 177 in the Resnet50 architecture, has been increased to 182 in the hybrid model. Thanks to these layer changes made in Resnet50, the accuracy rate has been increased more. Classification was performed with AlexNet, Resnet50, GoogLeNet, VGG16 and developed hybrid architectures using COVID-19 Chest X-Ray dataset and Chest X-Ray images (Pneumonia) dataseis. As a result, when other scientific works in the literature are examined, it is finalized that the improved hybrid method offers better results than other deep learning architectures and can be used in computer-aided systems to diagnose COVID-19 disease. © 2020 Lavoisier.

Establish a ""Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter"" distributed crawler framework to collect data. The system can judge the positive and negative emotions of the reviewer based on the comments, and can also reflect the depth of the seven emotions such as Hopeful, Happy, and Depressed. Finally, we improved the sentiment discriminant model of this system and compared the sentiment discriminant error of COVID-19 related comments with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results show that our model has better generalization ability and smaller discriminant error. We designed a large data visualization screen, which can clearly show the trend of public emotions, the proportion of various emotion categories, keywords, hot topics, etc., and fully and intuitively reflect the development of public opinion. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

A surge shift in online mode has been observed and it tremendously increased the internet traffic with a suitable rise in video content. Research and surveys state that these changes will become new normal and will last for a long time. As the bandwidths are limited and cannot be expanded instantly, there arose a need for alternate techniques to be explored to deal with growing video content efficiently. The lightweight and powerful deep learning based video compression and analytics techniques may help in efficiently processing video content. Deep learning based techniques are already giving potent results both in the video compression and video analytics domain independently.

Pneumonia impacts all the elderly and young people's families and children everywhere but is most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In December 2019 Wuhan, a city of China was affected by deadly, gruesome Pneumonia which was declared a pandemic by World Health Organisation. But the reason for the outbreak was not clear to everyone. Later, the doctors identified the disease as a new species of coronavirus, also currently known as COVID-19. The main motivation behind this research was to identify Pneumonia just by using the X-Ray images of the patients. As doctors must do a lot of certain tests to identify if the patient has Pneumonia or not. To solve the cumbersome problem, an ensemble of two deep learning models is developed, to make the work of the doctors simpler. In this paper, a comparison between previously written relevant research papers is done and concluded with an ensembled deep learning model to achieve a remarkable test data accuracy or unseen data accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,0,"B.M.S.

This study consisted of 131 portable CXR from 84 COVID-19 patients (51M 55.1±14.9yo; 29F 60.1±14.3yo; 4 missing information). Three expert chest radiologists scored the left and right lung separately based on the degree of opacity (0–3) and geographic extent (0–4). Deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to predict lung disease severity scores. Data were split into 80% training and 20% testing datasets. Correlation analysis between AI-predicted versus radiologist scores were analyzed. Comparison was made with traditional and transfer learning. The average opacity score was 2.52 (range: 0–6) with a standard deviation of 0.25 (9.9%) across three readers. The average geographic extent score was 3.42 (range: 0–8) with a standard deviation of 0.57 (16.7%) across three readers. The inter-rater agreement yielded a Fleiss’ Kappa of 0.45 for opacity score and 0.71 for extent score. AI-predicted scores strongly correlated with radiologist scores, with the top model yielding a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.90 (range: 0.73–0.90 for traditional learning and 0.83–0.90 for transfer learning) and a mean absolute error of 8.5% (ranges: 17.2–21.0% and 8.5%-15.5, respectively). Transfer learning generally performed better. In conclusion, deep-learning CNN accurately stages disease severity on portable chest x-ray of COVID-19 lung infection. This approach may prove useful to stage lung disease severity, prognosticate, and predict treatment response and survival, thereby informing risk management and resource allocation. © 2020 Zhu et al.

Fast diagnosis of COVID-19 and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resource optimisation is important. Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography. We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from seven cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images were used to pre-train the deep learning system, making it learn lung features. Following this, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19 (471 had follow-up for >5 days) and 342 with other pneumonia) from six cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system. In the four external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC 0.87 and 0.88, respectively) and viral pneumonia (AUC 0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time had significant difference (p=0.013 and p=0.014, respectively). Without human assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings. Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening of COVID-19 and identifying potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimisation and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.

As of April 23, 2020, 2.7 million cases have been confirmed, over 190,000 people are dead, and about 750,000 people are reported recovered. Yet, there is no publicly available data on tests that could be missing infections. Complicating matters and furthering anxiety are specific instances of false-negative tests. Methods: We developed a deep learning model to improve accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X-ray scans. Our model relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns. To do so, a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior-posterior radiographs of patients. We used publicly available datasets to achieve this. Results: Our results offer very high accuracy (96.3%) and loss (0.151 binary cross-entropy) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide. As the confusion matrix indicates, our model is able to accurately identify true negatives (74) and true positives (32); this deep learning model identified three cases of false-positive and one false-negative finding from the healthy patient scans. Conclusions: Our COVID-19 detection model minimizes manual interaction dependent on radiologists as it automates identification of structural abnormalities in patient’s CXRs, and our deep learning model is likely to detect true positives and true negatives and weed out false positive and false negatives with > 96.3% accuracy. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.",2020,14,"DeGroote School of Business, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street W, Hamilton, ON  L8S 4 M4, Canada; The Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Cancer Hospital, London, United Kingdom; Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, Department of Surgery, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Deep learning; Detection bias","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; child; classification; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; entropy; false negative result; false positive result; female; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; thorax radiography; transfer of learning; very elderly; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; middle aged; pandemic; statistical bias; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Bias; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Young Adult","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green","Prognosis",32462314,"International Orthopaedics",29817,"journal",1.533,"Q1",83,"Germany","Western Europe","1977-2020","Orthopedics and Sports Medicine (Q1); Surgery (Q1)","a9bbfc4dea014dc84a86b73d68ac82145e32987d",21,0,1,1,1,"2-s2.0-85085384850",3,57201252430,"Vaid S.",32,26,5,3,2,9,60031828,"McMaster University","can","Canada","ON",7102621894,"Bhandari M.",28370,21640,66,84,26,6574,60031828,"McMaster University","can","Canada","ON",28,28,28,12.95,2924,"2020-08-15","2020-05-28","2020-05-26",0,172,0,12.95,0,0,"2020-05-27","2021-02-08","2020-7-24",15,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00264-020-04609-7.pdf",9

Patients with COVID-19 face a high fatality risk once symptoms worsen; therefore, early identification of severely ill patients can enable early intervention, prevent disease progression, and help reduce mortality. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence-assisted tool using computed tomography (CT) imaging to predict disease severity and further estimate the risk of developing severe disease in patients suffering from COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Initial CT images of 408 confirmed COVID-19 patients were retrospectively collected between January 1, 2020 and March 18, 2020 from hospitals in Honghu and Nanchang. The data of 303 patients in the People’s Hospital of Honghu were assigned as the training data, and those of 105 patients in The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were assigned as the test dataset. A deep learning based-model using multiple instance learning and residual convolutional neural network (ResNet34) was developed and validated. The discrimination ability and prediction accuracy of the model were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve and confusion matrix, respectively. Results: The deep learning-based model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.987 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.968–1.00) and an accuracy of 97.4% in the training set, whereas it had an AUC of 0.892 (0.828–0.955) and an accuracy of 81.9% in the test set. In the subgroup analysis of patients who had non-severe COVID-19 on admission, the model achieved AUCs of 0.955 (0.884–1.00) and 0.923 (0.864–0.983) and accuracies of 97.0 and 81.6% in the Honghu and Nanchang subgroups, respectively. Conclusion: Our deep learning-based model can accurately predict disease severity as well as disease progression in COVID-19 patients using CT imaging, offering promise for guiding clinical treatment. © Copyright © 2020 Xiao, Li, Sun, Zhang, Xu, Zhu, Cai, He, Zhang, Ma, Hu, Gong, Liu, Shi and Zhu.",2020,3,"Department of Medical Quality Management, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; State Drug Clinical Trial Agency, The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Digital China Health Technologies Corporation Limited, Beijing, China; Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, China; Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China","computed tomography; COVID-19; deep learning; disease severity; multiple instance learning","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Hospitals; Learning systems; Patient treatment; Risk perception; Statistical tests; Area under the curves; Clinical treatments; Confidence interval; Discrimination ability; Disease progression; Learning Based Models; Multiple instance learning; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Computerized tomography","Frontiers Media S.A.","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green","Prognosis, Etiology, Epidemiology",32850746,"Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology",21100835954,"journal",0.908,"Q2",36,"Switzerland","Western Europe","2013-2020","Bioengineering (Q2); Biomedical Engineering (Q2); Biotechnology (Q2); Histology (Q2)","3d2e82033dfafd53a6a6376174608cf26650e8cf",5,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85089431189",15,57074350200,"Xiao L.",62,62,5,3,6,48,60002593,"Southern Medical University","chn","China","Guangdong",57216348215,"Zhu H.",24,24,8,3,2,52,60002593,"Southern Medical University","chn","China","Guangdong",4,4,4,1.00,1035,"2020-08-27","2020-07-31","2020-07-30",0,69,0,1,0,0,"2020-07-31","2021-02-11","2020-7-31",34,"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00898/full",7

Nuclei detection is an important example of this task. Imagine a faster research process for almost every deadly disease prevalent today. Diseases like cancer, heart diseases, COVID-19, rare disorders, etc. We have all seen or know some people who are fighting these diseases every day. Identifying the cells' nuclei is the starting point for most analyses because most of the human body's trillions of cells contain a nucleus full of DNA, the genetic code that programs each cell. The identification of nuclei helps researchers understand the underlying process. They can measure how different samples react to a certain drug. But, the manual process of identifying the cell's nuclei is a tedious task. This work proposes the use of deep learning techniques to perform segmentation and identify the cell's nuclei for which we chose a modified CNN architecture, U-Net. The results obtained show that U-Net can be a promising approach to efficiently segment and identify the cell's nuclei. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,0,"SVKM's NMIMS, Deparment of Computer Science and Engineering, Mumbai, India; Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., Mumbai, India","Computer Vision; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Nuclei Classification; Nuclei Detection; Nuclei Segmentation; U-Net","Cytology; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Diseases; Gene encoding; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Automatic segmentations; Image processing and analysis; Learning techniques; Manual process; Microscopic image; Nuclei detections; Nuclei segmentation; Research process; Convolutional neural networks","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","",NULL,NULL,"2020 11th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies, ICCCNT 2020",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"6d297d2205a326ffb6bf4463e1cf378b4f7540ee",0,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85096562740",3,57220031526,"Pudipeddi R.",0,0,1,0,1,2,60079592,"Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai","ind","India","MH",57215334089,"Gunda A.",0,0,2,0,2,6,115753115,"Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd","ind","India",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-10-15","2020-11-24","2020-11-23",15,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9211590/9225262/09225478.pdf?arnumber=9225478",4

Accompanying this pandemic is a parallel “infodemic,” including the online marketing and sale of unapproved, illegal, and counterfeit COVID-19 health products including testing kits, treatments, and other questionable “cures.” Enabling the proliferation of this content is the growing ubiquity of internet-based technologies, including popular social media platforms that now have billions of global users. Objective: This study aims to collect, analyze, identify, and enable reporting of suspected fake, counterfeit, and unapproved COVID-19–related health care products from Twitter and Instagram. Methods: This study is conducted in two phases beginning with the collection of COVID-19–related Twitter and Instagram posts using a combination of web scraping on Instagram and filtering the public streaming Twitter application programming interface for keywords associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 products. The second phase involved data analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to identify potential sellers that were then manually annotated for characteristics of interest. We also visualized illegal selling posts on a customized data dashboard to enable public health intelligence. Results: We collected a total of 6,029,323 tweets and 204,597 Instagram posts filtered for terms associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 health products from March to April for Twitter and February to May for Instagram. After applying our NLP and deep learning approaches, we identified 1271 tweets and 596 Instagram posts associated with questionable sales of COVID-19–related products. Generally, product introduction came in two waves, with the first consisting of questionable immunity-boosting treatments and a second involving suspect testing kits. We also detected a low volume of pharmaceuticals that have not been approved for COVID-19 treatment. Other major themes detected included products offered in different languages, various claims of product credibility, completely unsubstantiated products, unapproved testing modalities, and different payment and seller contact methods. Conclusions: Results from this study provide initial insight into one front of the “infodemic” fight against COVID-19 by characterizing what types of health products, selling claims, and types of sellers were active on two popular social media platforms at earlier stages of the pandemic. This cybercrime challenge is likely to continue as the pandemic progresses and more people seek access to COVID-19 testing and treatment. This data intelligence can help public health agencies, regulatory authorities, legitimate manufacturers, and technology platforms better remove and prevent this content from harming the public. © Tim Ken Mackey, Jiawei Li, Vidya Purushothaman, Matthew Nali, Neal Shah, Cortni Bardier, Mingxiang Cai, Bryan Liang.",2020,1,"Department of Anesthesiology and Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, 8950 Villa La Jolla Drive A124, San Diego, CA  92037, United States; Department of Healthcare Research and Policy, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States; Global Health Policy and Data Institute, San Diego, CA, United States; S-3 Research LLC, San Diego, CA, United States; Masters in Public Health Program, Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, San Diego, CA, United States; Masters Program in Global Health, Department of Anthropology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Cybercrime; Fraud; Infectious disease; Infodemic; Infodemiology; Infoveillance; Social media; Surveillance","","JMIR Publications Inc.","JMIR Publications Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,32750006,"JMIR Public Health and Surveillance",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"18e284920eedb500bec7c3e5e19d1f86d1bf7604",2,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85097873135",8,30067646600,"MacKey T.",2184,1608,1,26,13,175,60030612,"University of California, San Diego","usa","United States","CA",36658720400,"Liang B.",2028,1481,169,24,30,86,114420933,"Global Health Policy Institute","usa","United States","CA",117,51,78,228.57,1050,"2020-09-27","2020-08-05","2020-08-24",0,70,0,228.57,4.55,0,"2020-08-03","2020-08-25","2020-8-25",51,"",6

This pandemic has taken an enormous toll on the social, psychological, and economic stability of the humans. With the Coronavirus being extremely contagious, it becomes essential to automate the process of detecting the presence of this virus in humans. The diagnosis using Reverse Transcript Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is arduous and time-consuming; thus, the utilization of the chest X-rays has been proposed. Deep Learning algorithms often suffer from vanishing gradients and accuracy reduction with the increase in depth of the network. To efficiently tackle this issue on a limited dataset with severe class imbalance, this paper proposes an optimized variant of ResNet50, a Residual Network with Weighted Cross-Entropy loss to predict the presence of Coronavirus accurately in susceptible patients by analyzing their chest X-rays. The model yields reliable and stable results, with 97.5% Accuracy, 99% Positive Predictive Value, 96% Negative Predictive Value, 98.96% Specificity, and 96.11% sensitivity.

But the increasing number of false test results has opened the path for exploration of alternative testing tools. Chest X-Rays of COVID-19 patients have proved to be an important alternative indicator in COVID-19 screening. But again, accuracy depends upon radiological expertise. A diagnosis recommender system that can assist the doctor to examine the lung images of the patients will reduce the diagnostic burden of the doctor. Deep Learning techniques specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proven successful in medical imaging classification. Four different deep CNN architectures were investigated on images of chest X-Rays for diagnosis of COVID-19. These models have been pre-trained on the ImageNet database thereby reducing the need for large training sets as they have pre-trained weights.

Public perceptions toward such interventions should be identified to enable public health authorities to effectively address valid concerns. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been used to characterize user-generated content from social media during previous outbreaks, with the aim of understanding the health behaviors of the public. Objective: This study is aimed at developing and evaluating deep learning–based text classification models for classifying social media content posted during the COVID-19 outbreak, using the four key constructs of the HBM. We will specifically focus on content related to the physical distancing interventions put forth by public health authorities. We intend to test the model with a real-world case study. Methods: The data set for this study was prepared by analyzing Facebook comments that were posted by the public in response to the COVID-19–related posts of three public health authorities: the Ministry of Health of Singapore (MOH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England. The comments made in the context of physical distancing were manually classified with a Yes/No flag for each of the four HBM constructs: perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits. Using a curated data set of 16,752 comments, gated recurrent unit–based recurrent neural network models were trained and validated for text classification. Accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss were used to evaluate the model. Specificity, sensitivity, and balanced accuracy were used to evaluate the classification results in the MOH case study. Results: The HBM text classification models achieved mean accuracy rates of 0.92, 0.95, 0.91, and 0.94 for the constructs of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, respectively. In the case study with MOH Facebook comments, specificity was above 96% for all HBM constructs. Sensitivity was 94.3% and 90.9% for perceived severity and perceived benefits, respectively. In addition, sensitivity was 79.6% and 81.5% for perceived susceptibility and perceived barriers, respectively. The classification models were able to accurately predict trends in the prevalence of the constructs for the time period examined in the case study. Conclusions: The deep learning–based text classifiers developed in this study help to determine public perceptions toward physical distancing, using the four key constructs of HBM. Health officials can make use of the classification model to characterize the health behaviors of the public through the lens of social media. In future studies, we intend to extend the model to study public perceptions of other important interventions by public health authorities. © Aravind Sesagiri Raamkumar, Soon Guan Tan, Hwee Lin Wee.",2020,4,"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, 12 Science Drive 2, #10-01, Singapore, 117549, Singapore; Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","COVID-19; Deep learning; Health belief model; Physical distancing; Recurrent neural network; Social media; Text classification","","JMIR Publications Inc.","JMIR Publications Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,32540840,"JMIR Public Health and Surveillance",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"4bed8e95f97b56d3d13387efcba86a0f6b4eaabd",5,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85094975078",3,56613374900,"Sesagiri Raamkumar A.",99,92,19,5,6,18,60017161,"National University of Singapore","sgp","Singapore",NULL,8890187300,"Wee H.",1668,1486,2,22,19,391,60106366,"National University Health System","sgp","Singapore",NULL,4,3,4,2.50,1470,"2020-09-23","2020-06-17","2020-07-13",0,98,0,2.5,2.25,0,"2020-06-13","2021-02-22","2020-7-14",22,"",8

It is the worst health crisis the whole world has suffered after World War II. Many precautionary measures have been indicated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) like to maintain social distancing, wear masks, wash hands with soap for 20 seconds and many more. Wearing masks in public places is quite an effective measure to stay protected from this pandemic. There is very few research done for detecting face masks. This paper contributes to the welfare of human beings and proposes CoronaMask, a highly effective face mask detector. The proposed model uses the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm as a base for detecting faces. In this study, the dataset has been created which consists of 1238 images which are divided into two classes as “mask” and “no_mask”. This model also takes live streaming videos as input and detects faces which are wearing masks and which are not wearing a mask. The convolutional neural network is trained on the dataset and it gives 95% of accuracy. CoronaMask, a two-phase face mask detector works in identifying masks in images and also in real-time video streams. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays. A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive.

Within a span of just a few months, it has infected more than 4 million peoples across the globe due to its high transmittance rate. Thus, many governments have tried their best to increase the diagnostic capability of their hospitals so that the disease can be identified as early as possible. However, in most cases, the results only come back after a day or two, which directly increases the possibility of disease spreadness because of the delayed diagnosis. Therefore, a fast screening method using existing tools such as x-ray and computerized tomography scans can help alleviate the burden of mass diagnosis tests. A chest x-ray is one of the best modalities in diagnosing a pneumonia symptom, which is the primary symptom for COVID-19. Hence, this paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model to screen the possibility of COVID-19 accurately. A lightweight model is important, as such it allows the model to be deployed on various platforms that include mobile phones, tablets, and normal computers without worrying about the memory storage capacity. The proposed model is based on 14 layers of convolutional neural network with a modified spatial pyramid pooling module. The multiscale ability of the proposed network allows it to identify the COVID-19 disease for various severity levels. According to the performance results, the proposed SPP-COVID-Net achieves the best mean accuracy of 0.946 with the lowest standard deviation among the training folds accuracy. It comprises of just 862,331 total number of parameters, which uses less than 4 MegaBytes memory storage. The model is suitable to be implemented for fast screening purposes so that better-targeted diagnoses can be performed to optimize the test time and cost. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,3,"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Department of Electrical Electronic and Systems Engineering, Bangi, Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia, Community Health Department, Serdang, Malaysia","Compact Deep Learning; COVID-19 Detection; Lightweight Deep Learning Network","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,NULL,"2020 IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications, ISIEA 2020",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2f0ef8eae31bab7f4a808e908a9e6ca67cc74aca",3,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85091889177",3,57136808800,"Abdani S.",56,35,14,5,6,14,60001821,"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia","mys","Malaysia","Selangor",57219270988,"Hani Zulkifley N.",3,3,1,1,1,2,60025577,"Universiti Putra Malaysia","mys","Malaysia","Selangor",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-09-09","2021-01-27","2020-9-14",0,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9184188/9188070/09188133.pdf?arnumber=9188133",5

We previously predicted antivirals (atazanavir, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir) and non-antiviral drugs (tiotropium and rapamycin) that may inhibit the replication complex of SARS-CoV-2 using our molecular transformer drug target interaction (MT DTI) deep-learning-based drug target affinity prediction model. In this study, we dissected molecular pathways upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells by analyzing an RNA-seq data set with various bioinformatics approaches, such as gene ontology, protein protein interaction-based network and gene set enrichment analyses. The results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 infection strongly activates TNF and NFκB-signaling pathways through significant upregulation of the TNF, IL1B, IL6, IL8, NFKB1, NFKB2 and RELB genes. In addition to these pathways, lung fibrosis, keratinization/cornification, rheumatoid arthritis, and negative regulation of interferon-gamma production pathways were also significantly upregulated. We observed that these pathologic features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those observed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Intriguingly, tiotropium, as predicted by MT DTI, is currently used as a therapeutic intervention in COPD patients. Treatment with tiotropium has been shown to improve pulmonary function by alleviating airway inflammation. Accordingly, a literature search summarized that tiotropium reduced expressions of IL1B, IL6, IL8, RELA, NFKB1 and TNF in vitro or in vivo, and many of them have been known to be deregulated in COPD patients. These results suggest that COVID-19 is similar to an acute mode of COPD caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore tiotropium may be effective for COVID-19 patients. © 2020 by the authors.

Pneumonia, a major effect of COVID-19, needs to be urgently diagnosed along with its underlying reasons. In this paper, deep learning aided automated COVID-19 and other pneumonia detection schemes are proposed utilizing a small amount of COVID-19 chest X-rays. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture, named as CovXNet, is proposed that utilizes depthwise convolution with varying dilation rates for efficiently extracting diversified features from chest X-rays. Since the chest X-ray images corresponding to COVID-19 caused pneumonia and other traditional pneumonias have significant similarities, at first, a large number of chest X-rays corresponding to normal and (viral/bacterial) pneumonia patients are used to train the proposed CovXNet. Learning of this initial training phase is transferred with some additional fine-tuning layers that are further trained with a smaller number of chest X-rays corresponding to COVID-19 and other pneumonia patients. In the proposed method, different forms of CovXNets are designed and trained with X-ray images of various resolutions and for further optimization of their predictions, a stacking algorithm is employed. Finally, a gradient-based discriminative localization is integrated to distinguish the abnormal regions of X-ray images referring to different types of pneumonia. Extensive experimentations using two different datasets provide very satisfactory detection performance with accuracy of 97.4% for COVID/Normal, 96.9% for COVID/Viral pneumonia, 94.7% for COVID/Bacterial pneumonia, and 90.2% for multiclass COVID/normal/Viral/Bacterial pneumonias. Hence, the proposed schemes can serve as an efficient tool in the current state of COVID-19 pandemic.

Early detection and containment are currently the most effective methods for controlling the outbreak. A positive diagnosis is determined by laboratory real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, but the use of chest computed tomography (CT) has also been indicated as an important tool for detection and management of the disease. Numerous studies reviewed in this paper largely concur in their findings that the early hallmarks of COVID-19 infection are ground-glass opacities (GGOs), often with a bilateral and peripheral lung distribution. In addition, most studies demonstrated similar CT findings related to the progression of the disease, starting with GGOs in early disease, followed by the development of crazy paving in middle stages and finally increasing consolidation in the later stages of the disease. Studies have reported a low rate of misdiagnosis by chest CT, as well as a high rate of misdiagnosis by the rRT-PCR tests. Specifically, chest CT provides more accurate results in the early stages of COVID-19, when it is critical to begin treatment as well as isolate the patient to avoid the spread of the virus. While rRT-PCR will probably remain the definitive final test for COVID-19, until it is more readily available and can consistently provide higher sensitivity, the use of chest CT for early stage detection has proven valuable in avoiding misdiagnosis as well as monitoring the progression of the disease. With the understanding of the role of chest CT, researchers are beginning to apply deep learning and other algorithms to differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT scans, determine the severity of the disease to guide the course of treatment, and investigate numerous additional COVID-19 applications. Impact statement: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been worldwide, and clinicians and researchers around the world have been working to develop effective and efficient methods for early detection as well as monitoring of the disease progression. This minireview compiles the various agency and expert recommendations, along with results from studies published in numerous countries, in an effort to facilitate the research in imaging technology development to benefit the detection and monitoring of COVID-19.

SARS n-CoV2 is known to affect the lungs of the COVID-19 positive patients. Chest x-rays are the most widely used imaging technique for clinical diagnosis due to fast imaging time and low cost. The purpose of this study is to use deep learning technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest x-rays. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a data set containing confirmed COVID-19 positive, common bacterial pneumonia and healthy cases (no infection). A collection of 1,428 x-ray images is used in this study. The authors used a pre-trained VGG-16 model for the classification task. Transfer learning with fine-tuning was used in this study to effectively train the network on a relatively small chest x-ray data set. Initial experiments show that the model achieves promising results and can be greatly used to expedite COVID-19 detection. Findings: The authors achieved an accuracy of 96% and 92.5% in two and three output class cases, respectively. Based on these findings, the medical community can access using x-ray images as possible diagnostic tool for faster COVID-19 detection to complement the already testing and diagnosis methods.

A weakly-supervised deep learning framework was developed using 3D CT volumes for COVID-19 classification and lesion localization. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious; the COVID-19 lesions are localized by combining the activation regions in the classification network and the unsupervised connected components. 499 CT volumes were used for training and 131 CT volumes were used for testing. Our algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability and discover lesion regions in chest CT without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

Transmission parameters between compartments are typically estimated through stochastic parameterization processes that depends on detailed statistics of transmission characteristics, which are economically and resource-wise expensive to collect. Objective: We aim to apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purpose of simulating the dynamics of the US coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic and projecting its further development. Methods: We constructed a compartmental model and developed a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the model's transmission parameters. We then fed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict development of the US COVID-19 epidemic for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than 1. Results: The deep learning-enhanced compartmental model predicts that R0 will fall to &lt;1 around August 17-19, 2020, at which point the epidemic will effectively start to die out, and that the US “infected” population will peak around August 16-18, 2020, at 3,228,574 to 3,308,911 individual cases. The model also predicted that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 5 million mark around August 7, 2020. Conclusions: Current compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters. These models' effectiveness depends upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics. As an alternative, deep learning techniques are effective in estimating these stochastic parameters with greatly reduced dependency on data particularity. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

COVID-19 also known as Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus-2 is an infectious disease that is released from an infected sick person who speaks, sneezes, or coughs by respiratory droplets. This spreads quickly through close contact with anyone infected, or by touching objects or surfaces affected with a virus. There's still currently no vaccine available to protect against COVID-19 and preventing exposure to the virus seems to be the only method to safeguard ourselves. Wearing a facemask that covers the nose and mouth in a public setting and often washing hands or the use of at least 70% alcohol-based sanitizers is one way to avoid being exposed to the virus. Amid the advancement of technology, Deep Learning has proven its effectiveness in recognition and classification through image processing. The research study uses deep learning techniques in distinguishing facial recognition and recognize if the person is wearing a facemask or not. The dataset collected contains 25,000 images using 224x224 pixel resolution and achieved an accuracy rate of 96% as to the performance of the trained model. The system develops a Raspberry Pi-based real-time facemask recognition that alarms and captures the facial image if the person detected is not wearing a facemask. This study is beneficial in combating the spread of the virus and avoiding contact with the virus. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,1,"University of Antique, College of Engineering Architecture, Sibalom, Antique, Philippines; University of Antique, College of Arts and Sciences, Sibalom, Antique, Philippines","Alarm System; Deep Learning; Raspberry pi; Real-Time Facemask Recognition","Alarm systems; Face recognition; Learning systems; Viruses; Wear of materials; Accuracy rate; Current situation; Facial images; Facial recognition; Infectious disease; Learning techniques; Pixel resolution; Research studies; Deep learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,NULL,"2020 11th IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium, ICSGRC 2020 - Proceedings",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"621ccb14a6d1ee614869890ae67f48e4462fd11c",3,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096690902",2,57210596088,"Militante S.",25,15,13,3,2,11,124999248,"University of Antique","phl","Philippines",NULL,57215313933,"DIonisio N.",6,5,4,1,2,3,125429357,"School of Engineering and Technology","phl","Philippines",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-10-21","2020-11-03","2020-10-29",31,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9223048/9232452/09232610.pdf?arnumber=9232610",4

It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose: To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (6standard deviation) was 49 years 6 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P , .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusion: A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions. © RSNA, 2020.",2020,180,"Department of Radiology, Wuhan Huangpi People's Hospital, Wuhan, China; Jianghan University Affiliated Huangpi People's Hospital, Wuhan, China; Department of Radiology, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan, China; Keya Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shenzhen, China; Department of Radiology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, China; Department of Ct, Third Medical Center of Chinese Pla General Hospital, Beijing, China; Department of Radiology, Shenzhen Second People's Hosp./the First Affil.

While existing works focus on CT scans, this paper studies the application of DL techniques for the analysis of lung ultrasonography (LUS) images. Specifically, we present a novel fully-annotated dataset of LUS images collected from several Italian hospitals, with labels indicating the degree of disease severity at a frame-level, video-level, and pixel-level (segmentation masks). Leveraging these data, we introduce several deep models that address relevant tasks for the automatic analysis of LUS images. In particular, we present a novel deep network, derived from Spatial Transformer Networks, which simultaneously predicts the disease severity score associated to a input frame and provides localization of pathological artefacts in a weakly-supervised way. Furthermore, we introduce a new method based on uninorms for effective frame score aggregation at a video-level. Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate satisfactory results on all the considered tasks, paving the way to future research on DL for the assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 from LUS data. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",2020,42,"Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, Deep and Structured Machine Learning Research Program, University of Trento, Trento, Italy; Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, 38123, Italy; Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands; Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, Ultrasound Laboratory Trento (ULTRa), University of Trento, Trento, Italy; BresciaMEd, Brescia, Italy; Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Sciences, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli Irccs, Rome, Italy; Diagnostic and Interventional Ultrasound Unit, Valle Del Serchio General Hospital, Lucca, Italy","COVID-19; deep learning; lung ultrasound","Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Pixels; Ultrasonics; Automatic analysis; Disease severity; Imaging biomarkers; Lung ultrasound; Pixel level; Point of care; Segmentation masks; State of the art; Deep learning; gel; affine transform; Article; artificial ventilation; autoanalysis; benchmarking; classification; computer vision; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; deep learning; diagnostic imaging; disease marker; disease severity; disease severity assessment; echography; feature extraction; human; image analysis; image artifact; image reconstruction; image segmentation; Italy; k fold cross validation; lung disease; lung tuberculosis; middle income country; pandemic; pneumonia; point of care testing; prediction; scoring system; videorecording; Betacoronavirus; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; echography; lung; point of care system; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Point-of-Care Systems; Ultrasonography","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze","Prognosis, Diagnosis",32406829,"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",16733,"journal",3.276,"Q1",209,"United States","Northern America","1982-2020","Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Radiological and Ultrasound Technology (Q1); Software (Q1)","1343579da82015726f771402fe0564ec4a165dac",65,0,4,1,1,"2-s2.0-85087653114",22,57201643935,"Roy S.",89,88,8,4,4,28,60015986,"Università degli Studi di Trento","ita","Italy","TN",25654681100,"Demi L.",1191,699,1,19,14,185,60015986,"Università degli Studi di Trento","ita","Italy","TN",11,8,10,20.85,5320,"2020-07-12","2020-05-14","2020-07-31",0,266,0,20.85,0,0,"2020-05-13","2021-03-09","2020-10-5",47,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/42/9153182/09093068.pdf?arnumber=9093068",9

Materials and Methods: After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms. We then developed a word embedding–based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients’ self-reported symptoms. Results: Text analytics revealed that concepts such as smell and taste were more prevalent than expected in patients testing positive. As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms. The deep learning model yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.729 for predicting positive results and was subsequently applied to prioritize testing appointment scheduling.

The Internet has become an effective channel for social interactions nowadays. Peoples' immense dependence on digital platform opens doors for fraud. Phishing is a type of cybercrime to steal users' credentials from online platforms such as online banking, online business, e-commerce, online classroom, digital marketplaces, etc. Phishers develop fake webpages alike the original one and send spam emails to hook the users. Phishers seize users' credentials when an online user visits the counterfeit webpages through the spams. Researchers have introduced enormous tools like blacklist, white-list, and antivirus software to detect phishing webpages. Attackers always devise creative ways to exploit human and network weakness to penetrate cyber defense. This paper presents a data-driven framework for detecting phishing webpages using deep learning approach. More precisely, a multilayer perceptron, which is also referred as a feed-forward neural network is used to predict the phishing webpages. The dataset was collected from Kaggle and contains information of ten thousand webpages. It consists of ten attributes.

An early diagnosis is crucial in order to prevent new outbreaks and control its rapid spread. Medical imaging techniques, such as X-ray or chest computed tomography, are commonly used for this purpose due to their reliability for COVID-19 diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnosis systems could play an essential role in aiding radiologists in the screening process. In this work, a novel Deep Learning-based system, called COVID-XNet, is presented for COVID-19 diagnosis in chest X-ray images. The proposed system performs a set of preprocessing algorithms to the input images for variability reduction and contrast enhancement, which are then fed to a custom Convolutional Neural Network in order to extract relevant features and perform the classification between COVID-19 and normal cases. The system is trained and validated using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme, achieving an average accuracy of 94.43% and an AUC of 0.988. The output of the system can be visualized using Class Activation Maps, highlighting the main findings for COVID-19 in X-ray images.

Healthcare requires meticulousness in the whole process from collecting data to processing. It should also be handled in terms of data quality, data size, and data privacy. Various data are used within the scope of the COVID-19 outbreak struggle. Medical and location data collected from mobile phones and wearable devices are used to prevent the spread of the epidemic. In addition to this, artificial intelligence approaches are presented by using medical images in order to identify COVID-19 infected people. However, studies should be carried out by taking care not to endanger the security of the data, people, and countries needed for these useful applications. Therefore, differential privacy (DP) application, which was an interesting research subject, has been included in this study. CXR images have been collected from COVID-19 infected 139 and a total of 373 public data sources were used for a diagnostic concept. It has been trained with EfficientNet- B0, a recent and robust deep learning model, and proposal the possibility of infected with an accuracy of 94.7%. Other evaluation parameters were also discussed in detail. Despite the data constraint, this performance showed that it can be improved by augmenting the dataset. The most important aspect of the study was the proposal of differential privacy practice for such applications to be reliable in real-life use cases.

Deep learning has a potential to automate this task but requires a large set of high-quality annotations that are difficult to collect. Learning from noisy training labels that are easier to obtain has a potential to alleviate this problem. To this end, we propose a novel noise-robust framework to learn from noisy labels for the segmentation task. We first introduce a noise-robust Dice loss that is a generalization of Dice loss for segmentation and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss for robustness against noise, then propose a novel COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesion segmentation network (COPLE-Net) to better deal with the lesions with various scales and appearances. The noise-robust Dice loss and COPLE-Net are combined with an adaptive self-ensembling framework for training, where an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of a student model is used as a teacher model that is adaptively updated by suppressing the contribution of the student to EMA when the student has a large training loss. The student model is also adaptive by learning from the teacher only when the teacher outperforms the student. Experimental results showed that: (1) our noise-robust Dice loss outperforms existing noise-robust loss functions, (2) the proposed COPLE-Net achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art image segmentation networks, and (3) our framework with adaptive self-ensembling significantly outperforms a standard training process and surpasses other noise-robust training approaches in the scenario of learning from noisy labels for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",2020,10,"School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; SenseTime Research, Beijing, China; Fengcheng People's Hospital, Fengcheng, China; Huanggang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Huanggang, China; Xinyu City People's Hospital, Xinyu, China; Civil Aviation General Hospital, Beijing, China; Rimag Medical Imaging Corporation, Beijing, China; West China Biomedical Big Data Center, Sichuan University, West China Hospital, Chengdu, China","convolutional neural network; COVID-19; noisy label; pneumonia; segmentation","Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Personnel training; Students; Automatic segmentations; Exponential moving averages; Lesion segmentations; Mean absolute error; Robustness against noise; State of the art; Student Modeling; Training process; Computerized tomography; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; image segmentation; pneumonia; teacher; training; x-ray computed tomography; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; human; lung; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,32730215,"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",16733,"journal",3.276,"Q1",209,"United States","Northern America","1982-2020","Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Radiological and Ultrasound Technology (Q1); Software (Q1)","664c5bef7e60cc11e75132ecd3566db166d3607e",31,0,1,1,1,"2-s2.0-85088884716",10,55682589900,"Wang G.",959,803,40,12,9,152,60005465,"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","chn","China","Sichuan",13605200100,"Zhang S.",5156,4195,1,35,17,369,60005465,"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","chn","China","Sichuan",16,6,6,1.75,3020,"2020-11-15","2020-06-08","2020-07-31",0,151,0,1.75,1,0,"2020-06-05","2021-02-23","2020-9-7",48,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/42/9153182/09109297.pdf?arnumber=9109297",8

Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in developing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies to combat the disease. Although nucleic acid detection has been mainly used as the gold standard to confirm this RNA virus-based disease, it has been shown that such a strategy has a high false negative rate, especially for patients in the early stage, and thus CT imaging has been applied as a major diagnostic modality in confirming positive COVID-19. Despite the various, urgent advances in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided systems for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, most of the existing methods can only perform classification, whereas the state-of-the-art segmentation method requires a high level of human intervention. In this paper, we propose a fully-automatic, rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic method that can segment and quantify the infection regions on CT scans from different sources. Our method is founded upon two innovations: 1) the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19, by fitting the dynamic change of real patients' data measured at different time points, which greatly alleviates the data scarcity issue; and 2) a novel deep learning algorithm to solve the large-scene-small-object problem, which decomposes the 3D segmentation problem into three 2D ones, and thus reduces the model complexity by an order of magnitude and, at the same time, significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results over multi-country, multi-hospital, and multi-machine datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the existing ones and suggest its important application value in combating the disease. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",2020,7,"Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Cancer Systems Biology Center, China-Japan Union Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China; Heilongjiang Tuomeng Technology Company Ltd., Harbin, China; Department of Computer Tomography, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China; Department of Computer Tomography, First Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China; Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Instrumentation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China; Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Department Medical Imaging, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Institute of Information and Computer Engineering, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China","computerized tomography; COVID-19; deep learning; segmentation","Computer aided diagnosis; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Nucleic acids; Three dimensional computer graphics; Viruses; Computer-aided systems; Diagnostic modality; False negative rate; Human intervention; Nucleic acid detection; Quantification methods; Segmentation accuracy; Segmentation methods; Computerized tomography; Article; computer model; computer simulation; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; image processing; image segmentation; major clinical study; quantitative diagnosis; segmentation algorithm; signal processing; x-ray computed tomography; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; lung; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",NULL,32730214,"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",16733,"journal",3.276,"Q1",209,"United States","Northern America","1982-2020","Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Radiological and Ultrasound Technology (Q1); Software (Q1)","6224055d8e1ce1e8c16c5fd56a38ac4ef637aac7",18,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85088884075",16,57218351862,"Zhou L.",7,7,1,1,1,15,60092945,"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","sau","Saudi Arabia","Makkah",57216339080,"Gao X.",134,126,33,7,4,182,60092945,"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","sau","Saudi Arabia","Makkah",16,11,11,4.95,2480,"2020-11-20","2020-06-12","2020-07-31",0,124,0,4.95,2.95,0,"2020-06-11","2021-02-23","2020-9-7",37,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/42/9153182/09115057.pdf?arnumber=9115057",8

Limited availability of high-resolution computed tomography and real-time polymerase chain reaction in developing countries and regions of high patient turnover also emphasizes the importance of chest radiography as both a screening and diagnostic tool. In this paper, we compare the performance of 17 available deep learning algorithms to help identify imaging features of COVID19 pneumonia. We utilize an existing diagnostic technology (chest radiography) and preexisting neural networks (DarkNet-19) to detect imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our approach eliminates the extra time and resources needed to develop new technology and associated algorithms, thus aiding the front-line healthcare workers in the race against the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that DarkNet-19 is the optimal pre-trained neural network for the detection of radiographic features of COVID-19 pneumonia, scoring an overall accuracy of 94.28% over 5,854 X-ray images.

The study aimed to describe the full trajectory of lung mechanics of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. The clinical and ventilator setting that can influence patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) and compliance were explored. Post-extubation spirometry test was performed to assess the pulmonary function after COVID-19 induced ARDS. Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital. All patients with IMV due to COVID-19 induced ARDS were included. High-granularity ventilator waveforms were analyzed with deep learning algorithm to obtain PVAs. Asynchrony index (AI) was calculated as the number of asynchronous events divided by the number of ventilator cycles and wasted efforts. Mortality was recorded as the vital status on hospital discharge. Results: A total of 3,923,450 respiratory cycles in 2,778 h were analyzed (average: 24 cycles/min) for seven patients. Higher plateau pressure (Coefficient: −0.90; 95% CI: −1.02 to −0.78) and neuromuscular blockades (Coefficient: −6.54; 95% CI: −9.92 to −3.16) were associated with lower AI. Survivors showed increasing compliance over time, whereas non-survivors showed persistently low compliance. Recruitment maneuver was not able to improve lung compliance. Patients were on supine position in 1,422 h (51%), followed by prone positioning (499 h, 18%), left positioning (453 h, 16%), and right positioning (404 h, 15%). As compared with supine positioning, prone positioning was associated with 2.31 ml/cmH2O (95% CI: 1.75 to 2.86; p &lt; 0.001) increase in lung compliance. Spirometry tests showed that pulmonary functions were reduced to one third of the predicted values after extubation. Conclusions: The study for the first time described full trajectory of lung mechanics of patients with COVID-19. The result showed that prone positioning was associated with improved compliance; higher plateau pressure and use of neuromuscular blockades were associated with lower risk of AI. © Copyright © 2020 Ge, Pan, Zhou, Xu, Zhang, Zhang, Yi, Yang, Zhou, Liu and Zhang.",2020,1,"Department of Respiratory Care, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pulmonary Disease, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Infectious Diseases, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgery, Jingmen First People's Hospital, Jingmen, China; Department of Anesthesiology, The First People's of Hospital of Jingmen City, Jingmen, China; Department of Administration, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Emergency Medicine, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China","asynchonized; asynchrony; COVID-19; lung mechanics; mechanical ventilation; prone positioning","adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; breathing pattern; breathing rate; case report; clinical article; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; deep learning; extubation; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; hospital discharge; human; invasive ventilation; lung compliance; lung function; lung mechanics; male; maximal expiratory pressure; maximal inspiratory pressure; middle aged; neuromuscular blocking; patient positioning; peak expiratory flow; peak inspiratory flow; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; positive pressure ventilation; prone position; retrospective study; spirometry; supine position; survivor; tertiary care center; tidal volume; ventilated patient; very elderly; waveform; work of breathing","Frontiers Media S.A.","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,32974375,"Frontiers in Medicine",21100868809,"journal",1.180,"Q1",28,"Switzerland","Western Europe","2014-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q1)","fb88448e2a136ef7d91b40454b6eb3cb69721c8d",1,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85090390863",11,35409049800,"Ge H.",523,522,4,4,11,880,60118427,"Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital","chn","China","Zhejiang",36761802400,"Zhang Z.",3344,2915,1,30,14,610,60019572,"Hainan Medical University","chn","China","Hainan",2,2,2,0.50,630,"2020-09-28","2020-09-26","2020-08-20",0,42,0,0.5,0.5,0,"2020-08-21","2020-08-21","2020-8-21",33,"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmed.2020.00541/full",6

In order to diagnose COVID-19 more quickly, in this paper, a depthwise separable DenseNet was proposed. The paper constructed a deep learning model with 2 905 chest X-ray images as experimental dataset. In order to enhance the contrast, the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) algorithm was used to preprocess the X-ray image before network training, then the images were put into the training network and the parameters of the network were adjusted to the optimal. Meanwhile, Leaky ReLU was selected as the activation function. VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, DenseNet121 and SDenseNet models were used to compare with the model proposed in this paper.

The experience of the 1918 influenza pandemic demonstrated that decreases in the infection rates of COVID-19 do not guarantee continuity of the trend. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a precise spread model of COVID-19 with time-dependent parameters via deep learning to respond promptly to the dynamic situation of the outbreak and proactively minimize damage. Methods: In this study, we investigated a mathematical model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning based on forward-inverse problems. We used data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University for Korea and the other countries, respectively. Because the data consist of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, we selected the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and found approximated solutions as well as model parameters. Specifically, we applied fully connected neural networks to the solutions and parameters and designed suitable loss functions. Results: We developed an entirely new SIR model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning methods. Furthermore, we validated the model with the conventional Runge-Kutta fourth order model to confirm its convergent nature. In addition, we evaluated our model based on the real-world situation reported from the KCDC, the Korean government, and news media. We also crossvalidated our model using data from the CSSE for Italy, Sweden, and the United States. Conclusions: The methodology and new model of this study could be employed for short-term prediction of COVID-19, which could help the government prepare for a new outbreak. In addition, from the perspective of measuring medical resources, our model has powerful strength because it assumes all the parameters as time-dependent, which reflects the exact status of viral spread. © Se Young Jung, Hyeontae Jo, Hwijae Son, Hyung Ju Hwang.

Modeling and simulation of such problems pose an additional challenge of continuously evolving training data in which the model parameters change over time depending upon external factors. Our main contribution is that in a scenario of continuously evolving training data, unlike typical deep learning techniques, this non-intrusive algorithm eliminates the need to retrain or rebuild the model from scratch every time a new training data set is received. After validating the model, we use it to study the impact of different strategies for epidemic control. Finally, we propose and simulate a strategy of controlled natural immunization through risk-based population compartmentalization (PC) wherein the population is divided in Low Risk (LR) and High Risk (HR) compartments based on risk factors (like comorbidities and age) and subjected to different disease transmission dynamics by isolating the HR compartment while allowing the LR compartment to develop natural immunity. Upon release from the preventive isolation, the HR compartment finds itself surrounded by enough number of immunized individuals to prevent the spread of infection and thus most of the deaths occurring in this group are avoided. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,5,"Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Srinagar, India","Covid-19; Deep learning; Immunization; Incremental learning; Policy making","Data streams; Disease control; Immunization; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Disease transmission; Epidemic control; External factors; Incremental learning; Learning techniques; Model and simulation; Reduction strategy; Training data sets; Deep learning","Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green","Epidemiology, Etiology",NULL,"Chaos, Solitons and Fractals",25347,"journal",1.036,"Q1",132,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","1991-2020","Applied Mathematics (Q1); Mathematics (miscellaneous) (Q1); Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous) (Q1); Statistical and Nonlinear Physics (Q1)","8e7e144a3c19ba3e020eae3a23b5d18a78bf1441",5,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85088633221",2,57218292290,"Farooq J.",5,5,2,1,1,1,60072236,"National Institute of Technology Srinagar","ind","India","JK",35226206400,"Abid Bazaz M.",182,161,2,7,13,20,60072236,"National Institute of Technology Srinagar","ind","India","JK",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-07-21","2021-01-21","2020-11-10",38,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0960077920305440?httpAccept=text/xml",7

The training of a local DL model is performed with the dataset available from the edge; it is applied to the global model after receiving approval from the subject matter experts at the edge.

Efficient low-latency delay of transmission of video is a challenging problem which must also deal with the segmented nature of network infrastructure not always allowing a high throughput. Lossy video compression is a basic requirement to enable such technology widely. While this may compromise the quality of the streamed video there are recent deep learning based solutions to restore quality of a lossy compressed video. Considering the very nature of video conferencing, bitrate allocation in video streaming could be driven semantically, differentiating quality between the talking subjects and the background. Currently there have not been any work studying the restoration of semantically coded video using deep learning. In this work we show how such videos can be efficiently generated by shifting bitrate with masks derived via computer vision and how a deep generative adversarial network can be trained to restore video quality. Our study shows that the combination of semantic coding and learning based video restoration can provide superior results. © 2020 ACM.",2020,0,"MICC, Università Degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy","gans; semantic video compression; video quality enhancement","Deep learning; Image compression; Image reconstruction; Restoration; Semantics; Video conferencing; Adversarial networks; Bit-rate allocation; Compressed video; High throughput; Network infrastructure; User communication; Video perceptual qualities; Video restoration; Video signal processing","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","",NULL,NULL,"MM 2020 - Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"92fcc1481427fa2b2c3b5a1e967f4ca62557d8c0",0,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85096355156",5,57193498123,"Galteri L.",127,115,1,5,4,19,60021859,"Università degli Studi di Firenze","ita","Italy","FI",15018931800,"del Bimbo A.",8539,7019,3,44,39,332,60021859,"Università degli Studi di Firenze","ita","Italy","FI",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-10-12","2020-12-09","2020-12-9",48,"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3394171.3413508",4

Quantitative lesions may provide the radiological evidence of the severity of pneumonia and further to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19. Methods: 294 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from February, 24, 2020 to June, 1, 2020 from six centers. Multi-task Unet network was used to segment the whole lung and lesions from chest CT images. This deep learning method was pre-trained in 650 CT images (550 in primary dataset and 100 in test dataset) with COVID-19 or community-acquired pneumonia and Dice coefficients in test dataset were calculated. 50 CT scans of 50 patients (15 with comorbidity and 35 without comorbidity) were random selected to mark lesions manually. The results will be compared with the automatic segmentation model. Eight quantitative parameters were calculated based on the segmentation results to evaluate the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19. Results: Quantitative segmentation model was proved to be effective and accurate with all Dice coefficients more than 0.85 and all accuracies more than 0.95. Of the 294 patients, 52 (17.7%) patients were reported having at least one comorbidity; 14 (4.8%) having more than one comorbidity. Patients with any comorbidity were older (P < 0.001), had longer incubation period (P < 0.001), were more likely to have abnormal laboratory findings (P < 0.05), and be in severity status (P < 0.001). More lesions (including larger volume of lesion, consolidation, and ground-glass opacity) were shown in patients with any comorbidity than patients without comorbidity (all P < 0.001). More lesions were found on CT images in patients with more comorbidities. The median volumes of lesion, consolidation, and ground-glass opacity in diabetes mellitus group were largest among the groups with single comorbidity that had the incidence rate of top three. Conclusions: Multi-task Unet network can make quantitative CT analysis of lesions to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19, further to provide the radiological evidence of the severity of pneumonia. More lesions (including GGO and consolidation) were found in CT images of cases with comorbidity. The more comorbidities patients have, the more lesions CT images show. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,0,"Department of Radiology, TongDe Hospital of ZheJiang Province, No.234, Gucui Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310012, China; Department of Radiology Center, Second People's Hospital of Neijiang, Number 470, Road Xinjing, Neijiang, Sichuan, China; Department of Radiology, Wenzhou People's Hospital, Number 57, Road Canghou, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China; Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Number 287, Road Changhuai, Bengbu, Anhui, China; Department of Radiology, Anqing Municipal Hospital, Number 352, Road Renmin, Anqing, Anhui, China; Jianpei Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","Comorbidity; COVID-19; Deep learning; X-ray computed tomography","adult; age; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; community acquired pneumonia; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; female; hepatitis B; human; hypertension; image analysis; image segmentation; immune deficiency; incidence; incubation time; laboratory test; lung lesion; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; virus pneumonia; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; image processing; lung; pandemic; pneumonia; procedures; reproducibility; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","BioMed Central Ltd","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,33046116,"European Journal of Medical Research",13221,"journal",0.543,"Q2",55,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","1995-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q2)","aaba22098be278fb9ba5fa95e865e63ff92aa2e6",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85092576933",10,57219409865,"Zhang C.",0,0,3,0,2,21,101394122,"Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province","chn","China","Zhejiang",57211091314,"Wang J.",6,6,1,1,3,52,124539698,"Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province","chn","China","Zhejiang",6,6,6,1.75,799,"2021-02-18","2020-10-23","2020-10-11",0,47,0,1.75,1.75,1.5,"2020-10-12","2020-10-12","2020-10-12",30,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40001-020-00450-1.pdf",4

Moreover, the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak forced many nations (e.g. Italy, the US, and other countries) to massively push their education system towards an online environment. Academics now are also looking at the crisis as an opportunity for universities to adopt digital technologies for teaching more broadly. But they will have to understand what possible ways of evaluating and effectively teaching will be in this new scenario. The depicted overview, in conjunction with the utility and ubiquitous access to the educational platforms of online courses, entails a vast amount of enrolments. Nevertheless, a high enrolment rate usually translates into a significant dropout (or withdrawal) rate of students (40-80% of online students drop out). Student dropout prediction (SDP) consists of modelling and fore-casting student behaviour when interacting with e-learning platforms. It is a significant phenomenon that has repercussions on online institutions, the involved students and professors. Early approaches tended to perform manual analytic examinations to devise retention strategies. Recent research has adopted automated policies to thoroughly exploit the advantages of student activities(hereafter e-tivities) in the e-platforms and identify at-risk students. These approaches include machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict the student dropout status.

Countries like India, Bangladesh, and other developing countries are still having a slow pace in the detection of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fast detection with clear visualization of infection is required using which a suspected patient of COVID-19 could be saved. In the recent technological advancements, the fusion of deep learning classifiers and medical images provides more promising results corresponding to traditional RT-PCR testing while making detection and predictions about COVID-19 cases with increased accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed a deep transfer learning algorithm that accelerates the detection of COVID-19 cases by using X-ray and CT-Scan images of the chest. It is because, in COVID-19, initial screening of chest X-ray (CXR) may provide significant information in the detection of suspected COVID-19 cases. We have considered three datasets known as 1) COVID-chest X-ray, 2) SARS-COV-2 CT-scan, and 3) Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia). In the obtained results, the proposed deep learning model can detect the COVID-19 positive cases in ≤ 2 seconds which is faster than RT-PCR tests currently being used for detection of COVID-19 cases. We have also established a relationship between COVID-19 patients along with the Pneumonia patients which explores the pattern between Pneumonia and COVID-19 radiology images. In all the experiments, we have used the Grad-CAM based color visualization approach in order to clearly interpretate the detection of radiology images and taking further course of action. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,7,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat, Solan HP  173 234, India; School of Engineering and Sciences, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Av.

Although governments imposing numerous containment and social distancing measures, the need for the healthcare systems has dramatically increased and the effective management of infected patients becomes a challenging problem for hospitals. Thus, accurate short-term forecasting of the number of new contaminated and recovered cases is crucial for optimizing the available resources and arresting or slowing down the progression of such diseases. Recently, deep learning models demonstrated important improvements when handling time-series data in different applications. This paper presents a comparative study of five deep learning methods to forecast the number of new cases and recovered cases. Specifically, simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated recurrent units (GRUs) and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) algorithms have been applied for global forecasting of COVID-19 cases based on a small volume of data. This study is based on daily confirmed and recovered cases collected from six countries namely Italy, Spain, France, China, USA, and Australia. Results demonstrate the promising potential of the deep learning model in forecasting COVID-19 cases and highlight the superior performance of the VAE compared to the other algorithms. © 2020",2020,16,"Faculty of technology, Department of electrical engineering, University of 20 August 1955, Skikda, 21000, Algeria; LAIG Laboratory, University of 08 May 1945, Guelma, 24000, Algeria; Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia; University of Science and Technology of Oran-Mohamed Boudiaf (USTO-MB), Computer Science department Signal, image and speech laboratory (SIMPA) laboratory, El Mnaouar, Bir El Djir 31000, Oran, BP  1505, Algeria","COVID-19; Data-driven; Deep learning; Forecasting; Gated recurrent units; Long short-term memory; Recurrent neural network; Variational autoencoder","Data handling; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Recovery; Time series; Comparative studies; Effective management; Health-care system; Infected patients; Research communities; Short-term forecasting; Simple recurrent neural networks; Time-series data; Deep learning","Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green","General",32834633,"Chaos, Solitons and Fractals",25347,"journal",1.036,"Q1",132,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","1991-2020","Applied Mathematics (Q1); Mathematics (miscellaneous) (Q1); Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous) (Q1); Statistical and Nonlinear Physics (Q1)","e5f8648e788097923d789b7cfc44ed039f2523b4",23,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85088226654",4,57214856786,"Zeroual A.",23,23,2,2,1,3,60069303,"Université 8 Mai 1945 Guelma","dza","Algeria","Guelma Province",55737745300,"Sun Y.",1620,1165,1,20,12,107,60092945,"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","sau","Saudi Arabia","Makkah",12,9,10,4.55,3128,"2021-03-03","2020-08-26","2020-10-31",0,184,0,4.55,3.55,3.55,"2020-07-15","2021-02-26","2020-11-28",44,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S096007792030518X?httpAccept=text/xml",7

The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) encourages the use of telemedicine for patients with respiratory symptoms. This study, therefore, purposes automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a deep learning framework with self-taken throat images. Methods: A dataset composed of two classes of 131 throat images with pharyngitis and 208 normal throat images was collected. Before the training classifier, we constructed a cycle consistency generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to augment the training dataset. The ResNet50, Inception-v3, and MobileNet-v2 architectures were trained with transfer learning and validated using a randomly selected test dataset. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Results: The CycleGAN-based synthetic images reflected the pragmatic characteristic features of pharyngitis. Using the synthetic throat images, the deep learning model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the pharyngitis diagnosis. ResNet50 with GAN-based augmentation showed the best ROC-AUC of 0.988 for pharyngitis detection in the test dataset. In the 4-fold cross-validation using the ResNet50, the highest detection accuracy and ROC-AUC achieved were 95.3% and 0.992, respectively. Conclusion: The deep learning model for smartphone-based pharyngitis screening allows fast identification of severe pharyngitis with a potential of the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis. In the recent pandemic of COVID-19, this framework will help patients with upper respiratory symptoms to improve convenience in diagnosis and reduce transmission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,1,"Department of Ophthalmology, Aerospace Medical Center, Republic of Korea Air Force, Cheongju, South Korea; Epilepsy Center, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States; Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, 10th Fighter Wing, Republic of Korea Air Force, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul Women's Hospital, Bucheon, South Korea; B&VIIT Eye Center, Seoul, South Korea; VISUWORKS, Seoul, South Korea","Automated diagnosis; Deep learning; Pharyngitis; Smartphone; Telemedicine; Tonsillitis","Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Smartphones; Statistical tests; Transfer learning; Adversarial networks; Automated detection; Detection accuracy; Learning frameworks; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Respiratory symptoms; Smart-phone cameras; Synthetic images; Deep learning; area under the curve; Article; automation; controlled study; convolutional neural network; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; pharyngitis; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; transfer of learning; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; pandemic; pharyngitis; pharynx; photography; procedures; smartphone; telemedicine; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pandemics; Pharyngitis; Pharynx; Photography; Pneumonia, Viral; Smartphone; Telemedicine","Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green","Treatment, Diagnosis","","Computers in Biology and Medicine",17957,"journal",0.834,"Q2",83,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","1970-2020","Computer Science Applications (Q2); Health Informatics (Q2)","63b192467dc88fa4f7f05b83416f759ede4becb1",0,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85089902328",5,54788607400,"Yoo T.",382,329,31,12,10,49,122224731,"Aerospace Medical Center","kor","South Korea","Chungcheongbuk-do",57189390195,"Ryu I.",64,57,11,4,5,23,116573399,"B&VIIT Eye Center","kor","South Korea",NULL,1,1,1,1.00,1406,"2020-08-29","2020-08-29","2020-09-30",0,74,0,1,0,0,"2020-08-20","2021-02-01","2021-2-1",48,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0010482520303115?httpAccept=text/xml",6

The proposed prediction model caters to this objective following a stepwise approach through cleaning, feature extraction, and classification. The cleaning process constitutes the cleaning of missing values, which is proceeded by outlier detection using the interpolation of splines and entropy-correlation. The cleaned data is then subjected to a feature extraction process using Principle Component Analysis. A Fitness Oriented Dragon Fly algorithm is introduced to select optimal features, and the resultant feature vector is fed into the Deep Belief Network.

Despite the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak, relatively few diagnostic images are openly available to develop automatic diagnosis algorithms. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle when data is highly unbalanced with many cases in one class and only a few cases in another; new methods must be developed to overcome this challenge. We propose a novel activation function based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution from extreme value theory, which improves performance over the traditional sigmoid activation function when one class significantly outweighs the other. We demonstrate the proposed activation function on a publicly available dataset and externally validate on a dataset consisting of 1,909 healthy chest X-rays and 84 COVID-19 X-rays. The proposed method achieves an improved area under the receiver operating characteristic (DeLong's p-value < 0.05) compared to the sigmoid activation. Our method is also demonstrated on a dataset of healthy and pneumonia vs. COVID-19 X-rays and a set of computerized tomography images, achieving improved sensitivity. The proposed GEV activation function significantly improves upon the previously used sigmoid activation for binary classification.

The test set consisted of a CXR on presentation of 248 individuals suspected of COVID-19 pneumonia between February 16 and March 3, 2020 from 4 centers (72 RT-PCR positives and 176 RT-PCR negatives). The CXR were independently reviewed by 3 radiologists and using the DL algorithm. Diagnostic performance was compared with radiologists' performance and was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC).Results:The median age of the subjects in the test set was 61 (interquartile range: 39 to 79) years (51% male). The DL algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.81, sensitivity of 0.85, and specificity of 0.72 in detecting COVID-19 using RT-PCR as the reference standard. On subgroup analyses, the model achieved an AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.80, and specificity of 0.74 in detecting COVID-19 in patients presented with fever or respiratory systems and an AUC of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.85, and specificity of 0.81 in distinguishing COVID-19 from other forms of pneumonia.

However, there is currently a lack of proven effective medications against COVID-19. Drug repurposing offers a promising route for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19. This study reports an integrative, network-based deep-learning methodology to identify repurposable drugs for COVID-19 (termed CoV-KGE). Specifically, we built a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Using Amazon's AWS computing resources and a network-based, deep-learning framework, we identified 41 repurposable drugs (including dexamethasone, indomethacin, niclosamide, and toremifene) whose therapeutic associations with COVID-19 were validated by transcriptomic and proteomics data in SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells and data from ongoing clinical trials. Whereas this study by no means recommends specific drugs, it demonstrates a powerful deep-learning methodology to prioritize existing drugs for further investigation, which holds the potential to accelerate therapeutic development for COVID-19. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

Detection of facial masks in video footages is a challenging task primarily due to the fact that the masks themselves behave as occlusions to face detection algorithms due to the absence of facial landmarks in the masked regions. In this work, we propose an approach for detecting facial masks in videos using deep learning. The proposed framework capitalizes on the MTCNN face detection model to identify the faces and their corresponding facial landmarks present in the video frame. These facial images and cues are then processed by a neoteric classifier that utilises the MobileNetV2 architecture as an object detector for identifying masked regions. The proposed framework was tested on a dataset which is a collection of videos capturing the movement of people in public spaces while complying with COVID-19 safety protocols.

This paper is based on Faster R-CNN, an end-to-end target detection model, to realize the detection of lesions in CT images of the novel coronavirus, which contributes to track the later condition of the confirmed patients and conduct timely treatment. Firstly, Kmeans++ was carried out to cluster the dimensions of the bounding box of the ground truth in annotated CT images, and appropriate anchors sizes and ratios were selected. Then, the performance of the Faster R-CNN model based on VGG-16 and ResNet-50 on the original datasets and the augment datasets is compared.

In this work, we propose a new multitask deep learning model to jointly identify COVID-19 patient and segment COVID-19 lesion from chest CT images. Three learning tasks: segmentation, classification and reconstruction are jointly performed with different datasets. Our motivation is on the one hand to leverage useful information contained in multiple related tasks to improve both segmentation and classification performances, and on the other hand to deal with the problems of small data because each task can have a relatively small dataset. Our architecture is composed of a common encoder for disentangled feature representation with three tasks, and two decoders and a multi-layer perceptron for reconstruction, segmentation and classification respectively. The proposed model is evaluated and compared with other image segmentation techniques using a dataset of 1369 patients including 449 patients with COVID-19, 425 normal ones, 98 with lung cancer and 397 of different kinds of pathology.

It can outbreak in the world through person-to-person transmission.

The main objective of the proposed framework is to bridge the current gap between current technologies and healthcare systems. The wireless body area network, cloud computing, fog computing, and clinical decision support system are integrated to provide a comprehensive and complete model for disease detection and monitoring. By monitoring a person with COVID-19 in real time, physicians can guide patients with the right decisions. The proposed framework has three main layers (i.e., a patient layer, cloud layer, and hospital layer). In the patient layer, the patient is tracked through a set of wearable sensors and a mobile app. In the cloud layer, a fog network architecture is proposed to solve the issues of storage and data transmission. In the hospital layer, we propose a convolutional neural network-based deep learning model for COVID-19 detection based on patient’s X-ray scan images and transfer learning. The proposed model achieved promising results compared to the state-of-the art (i.e., accuracy of 97.95% and specificity of 98.85%).

AI-driven tools are used to identify Coronavirus outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread, where imaging techniques are widely used, such as CT scans and chest X-rays (CXRs). In this paper, motivated by the fact that X-ray imaging systems are more prevalent and cheaper than CT scan systems, a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which we call Truncated Inception Net, is proposed to screen COVID-19 positive CXRs from other non-COVID and/or healthy cases. To validate our proposal, six different types of datasets were employed by taking the following CXRs: COVID-19 positive, Pneumonia positive, Tuberculosis positive, and healthy cases into account. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99.96% (AUC of 1.0) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia and healthy cases. Similarly, it achieved an accuracy of 99.92% (AUC of 0.99) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and healthy CXRs. To the best of our knowledge, as of now, the achieved results outperform the existing AI-driven tools for screening COVID-19 using the acquired CXRs, and proves the viability of using the proposed Truncated Inception Net as a screening tool. © 2020, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.",2020,21,"Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India; Department of Computer Science, University of South Dakota, Vermillion, SD  57069, United States; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India","Chest X-rays; CNN; COVID-19; Deep learning; Inception net; Pneumonia; Tuberculosis","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Chest x-rays; Coronaviruses; Screening tool; Short periods; X ray imaging system; Computerized tomography; Article; artificial intelligence; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; epidemic; human; major clinical study; pneumonia; thorax radiography; truncated inception net; tuberculosis; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; factual database; lung; pandemic; receiver operating characteristic; statistical model; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Humans; Lung; Models, Statistical; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiography, Thoracic; ROC Curve; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Springer","Springer","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",NULL,32588200,"Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine",28047,"journal",0.312,"Q3",28,"Netherlands","Western Europe","1983-2020","Biomedical Engineering (Q3); Biophysics (Q3); Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous) (Q3); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q3)","17c61337f11e49e861e0b53884f53d8efbb61907",43,0,3,1,1,"2-s2.0-85086873335",3,57212306074,"Das D.",30,30,12,2,3,24,60103561,"National Institute of Technology, Durgapur","ind","India","WB",57200742116,"Pal U.",5855,3257,56,36,27,353,60024948,"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata","ind","India","WB",9,5,5,1.50,1695,"2020-11-18","2020-09-19","2020-06-24",0,113,0,1.5,1.5,0,"2020-06-25","2021-03-15","2020-9-10",31,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13246-020-00888-x.pdf",8

Physical activities disruption due to Covid-19 pandemic rapidly increases the online food order. Online Customers relies on available good quality food images and metadata information, to make decision of the type of food to order. Recently developed deep learning networks outperform the classical approaches for visual food recognition, however these networks thirsts for large datasets to achieve best performance. Majority population of present online customers order food to small-scale restaurants, these restaurants deals with small datasets, thus restricted them to take advantage of modern tools and to participate in the billion-digital business. In this work, we modified the existing deep-CNN architecture to fit the small-scale restaurant dataset and trained on an end-to-end DeepLab v3+ initialized from ResNet weight. Our proposed novel architecture is designed by exploiting the output of multiscale contextual information of CNN encoder and fed in the low-level features of our constructed Resnet-18 as the backbone network, and finally fine-tuned with simple filters, and bilinear interpolation on the order factor by 4. This approach reduces the serious overfitting of the deep-CNN. The metadata recognition was done using enhanced-OCR, where the segmented image was analyzed at high-level layers.

Transmission of this disease occurs among people through droplets which causes severe respiratory distress and in turn can also lead to fatal death. At the pinnacle of this pandemic, scientists endeavor to discover the medication for the COVID-19 victims. Artificial Intelligence algorithms, especially, deep learning, on the other hand, is used for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 patients but this requires an enormous radiographic data set to effectively provide an optimized outcome for a particular scenario. This work presents a new technique called 'Deep Greedy Network' which will work efficiently with a finite number of datasets. In spite of peculiarity caused due to limited dataset, the anomaly of overfitting and underfitting could be effectively overcome using the proposed algorithm. This, in turn, is simultaneously going to be both cost-effective and efficient.

With appropriate data of each patient, hospitals can heuristically predict whether or not a patient requires immediate care. We adopted a deep learning model to predict fatality of individuals tested positive given the patient's underlying health conditions, age, sex, and other factors. As the allocation of resources toward a vulnerable patient could mean the difference between life and death, a fatality prediction model serves as a valuable tool to healthcare workers in prioritizing resources and hospital space. The models adopted were evaluated and refined using the metrics of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. After data preprocessing and training, our model is able to predict whether a covid-19 confirmed patient is likely to be dead or not, given their information and disposition. The metrics between the different models are compared.

Daily increase in cases of COVID-19 patients worldwide and limited number of available detection kits pose difficulty in identifying the presence of disease. Therefore, at this point of time, necessity arises to look for other alternatives. Among already existing, widely available and low-cost resources, X-ray is frequently used imaging modality and on the other hand, deep learning techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performances in computer-aided medical diagnosis. Therefore, an alternative diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 cases utilizing available resources and advanced deep learning techniques is proposed in this work. The proposed method is implemented in four phases, viz., data augmentation, preprocessing, stage-I and stage-II deep network model designing. This study is performed with online available resources of 1215 images and further strengthen by utilizing data augmentation techniques to provide better generalization of the model and to prevent the model overfitting by increasing the overall length of dataset to 1832 images. Deep network implementation in two stages is designed to differentiate COVID-19 induced pneumonia from healthy cases, bacterial and other virus induced pneumonia on X-ray images of chest. Comprehensive evaluations have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with both (i) training-validation-testing and (ii) 5-fold cross validation procedures. High classification accuracy as 97.77%, recall as 97.14% and precision as 97.14% in case of COVID-19 detection shows the efficacy of proposed method in present need of time. Further, the deep network architecture showing averaged accuracy/sensitivity/specificity/precision/F1-score of 98.93/98.93/98.66/96.39/98.15 with 5-fold cross validation makes a promising outcome in COVID-19 detection using X-ray images. © 2020 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences",2020,6,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Medical Engineering and Computer Science (EMI), Hochschule Offenburg, Offenburg, Germany; Department of Electrical and Instrumentation Engineering, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, Punjab, India; Department of Electrical Engineering, Medical Engineering and Computer Science (EMI), Hochschule Offenburg, Offenburg, Germany; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, Punjab, India","Computer-aided diagnosis; Coronavirus detection; Covid-19; Deep learning; Pneumonia; X-ray","aged; Article; case report; clinical article; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; cross validation; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; image processing; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; transfer of learning; virus pneumonia","Elsevier Sp. z o.o.","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green","Diagnosis",32921862,"Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering",19400158663,"journal",0.597,"Q2",22,"Poland","Eastern Europe","2008-2020","Biomedical Engineering (Q2)","aa5c463790d8fdc9184d8492e26f35430526408e",9,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85090943942",4,57218993659,"Jain G.",6,6,1,1,1,3,60005597,"University of Applied Sciences Offenburg","deu","Germany","Baden-Wurttemberg",54897836100,"Mittal M.",61,44,1,5,5,8,60001166,"Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology","ind","India","PB",3,3,3,1.00,1365,"2020-11-05","2020-11-05","2020-09-30",0,91,0,1,1,0,"2020-09-07","2021-03-02","2021-1-14",40,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0208521620301005?httpAccept=text/xml",5

We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm on the basis of chest CT for rapid triaging in fever clinics. Methods: We trained a U-Net-based model on unenhanced chest CT scans obtained from 2447 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Feb 1, 2020, and March 3, 2020 (1647 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and 800 patients without COVID-19) to segment lung opacities and alert cases with COVID-19 imaging manifestations. The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to triage patients suspected to have COVID-19 was assessed in a large external validation set, which included 2120 retrospectively collected consecutive cases from three fever clinics inside and outside the epidemic centre of Wuhan (Tianyou Hospital [Wuhan, China; area of high COVID-19 prevalence], Xianning Central Hospital [Xianning, China; area of medium COVID-19 prevalence], and The Second Xiangya Hospital [Changsha, China; area of low COVID-19 prevalence]) between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 14, 2020. To validate the sensitivity of the algorithm in a larger sample of patients with COVID-19, we also included 761 chest CT scans from 722 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 treated in a makeshift hospital (Guanggu Fangcang Hospital, Wuhan, China) between Feb 21, 2020, and March 6, 2020. Additionally, the accuracy of AI was compared with a radiologist panel for the identification of lesion burden increase on pairs of CT scans obtained from 100 patients with COVID-19. Findings: In the external validation set, using radiological reports as the reference standard, AI-aided triage achieved an area under the curve of 0·953 (95% CI 0·949–0·959), with a sensitivity of 0·923 (95% CI 0·914–0·932), specificity of 0·851 (0·842–0·860), a positive predictive value of 0·790 (0·777–0·803), and a negative predictive value of 0·948 (0·941–0·954). AI took a median of 0·55 min (IQR: 0·43–0·63) to flag a positive case, whereas radiologists took a median of 16·21 min (11·67–25·71) to draft a report and 23·06 min (15·67–39·20) to release a report. With regard to the identification of increases in lesion burden, AI achieved a sensitivity of 0·962 (95% CI 0·947–1·000) and a specificity of 0·875 (95 %CI 0·833–0·923). The agreement between AI and the radiologist panel was high (Cohen's kappa coefficient 0·839, 95% CI 0·718–0·940). Interpretation: A deep learning algorithm for triaging patients with suspected COVID-19 at fever clinics was developed and externally validated. Given its high accuracy across populations with varied COVID-19 prevalence, integration of this system into the standard clinical workflow could expedite identification of chest CT scans with imaging indications of COVID-19.

The proposed approach, xDNN is using prototypes. Prototypes are actual training data samples (images), which are local peaks of the empirical data distribution called typicality as well as of the data density. This generative model is identified in a closed form and equates to the pdf but is derived automatically and entirely from the training data with no user- or problem-specific thresholds, parameters or intervention. The proposed xDNN offers a new deep learning architecture that combines reasoning and learning in a synergy. It is non-iterative and non-parametric, which explains its efficiency in terms of time and computational resources. From the user perspective, the proposed approach is clearly understandable to human users. We tested it on challenging problems as the classification of different lighting conditions for driving scenes (iROADS), object detection (Caltech-256, and Caltech-101), and SARS-CoV-2 identification via computed tomography scan (COVID CT-scans dataset). xDNN outperforms the other methods including deep learning in terms of accuracy, time to train and offers an explainable classifier. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,4,"School of Computing and Communications, LIRA Research Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4WA, United Kingdom","Deep-learning; Explainable AI; Interpretability; Prototype-based models","Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Deep neural networks; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Object detection; Program processors; Computational resources; Computed tomography scan; Generative model; Internal architecture; Learning approach; Learning architectures; Lighting conditions; User perspectives; Deep learning; article; classifier; deep learning; deep neural network; human; illumination; nonhuman; reasoning; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; x-ray computed tomography; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; image processing; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green",NULL,32682084,"Neural Networks",24804,"journal",1.718,"Q1",136,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","1988-2020","Artificial Intelligence (Q1); Cognitive Neuroscience (Q1)","5660c5ec41ab8e76b21f3ffafa5f4f663914ac7f",18,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85087911322",2,7003690831,"Angelov P.",6767,3526,14,42,30,248,60117772,"School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University","gbr","United Kingdom","Lancashire",57195931360,"Soares E.",71,63,14,3,4,23,60117772,"School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University","gbr","United Kingdom","Lancashire",7,4,4,1.50,2432,"2020-11-04","2020-09-19","2020-09-30",0,132,0,1.5,1.5,0,"2020-07-12","2021-01-14","2020-9-1",44,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0893608020302513?httpAccept=text/xml",7

While chest computed tomography (CT) plays an indispensable role in its diagnosis, the quantification and localization of lesions cannot be accurately assessed manually. We employed deep learning-based software to aid in detection, localization and quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A total of 2460 RT-PCR tested SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (1250 men and 1210 women; mean age, 57.7 ± 14.0 years (age range, 11–93 years) were retrospectively identified from Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan from February 11 to March 16, 2020. Basic clinical characteristics were reviewed. The uAI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System was used to assess the CT scans. Results: CT scans of 2215 patients (90%) showed multiple lesions of which 36 (1%) and 50 patients (2%) had left and right lung infections, respectively (' 50% of each affected lung’s volume), while 27 (1%) had total lung infection (' 50% of the total volume of both lungs). Overall, 298 (12%), 778 (32%) and 1300 (53%) patients exhibited pure ground glass opacities (GGOs), GGOs with sub-solid lesions and GGOs with both sub-solid and solid lesions, respectively. Moreover, 2305 (94%) and 71 (3%) patients presented primarily with GGOs and sub-solid lesions, respectively. Elderly patients (≥ 60 years) were more likely to exhibit sub-solid lesions. The generalized linear mixed model showed that the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe was the favoured site of COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion: Chest CT combined with analysis by the uAI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System can accurately evaluate pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,5,"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Tangdu Hospital, Air Force Military Medical University, Xi’an, 710038, China; Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, 430100, China; Department of Radiology, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Military Medical University, Xi’an, 710038, China; Tangdu Hospital, Air Force Military Medical University, Xi’an, 710038, China; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Military Medical University, Xi’an, 710038, China","2019 novel coronavirus; Artificial intelligence (AI); Computed tomography (CT); Ground glass opacity (GGO); Viral pneumonia","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; automation; child; chronic kidney failure; chronic lung disease; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; deep learning; diabetes mellitus; dyspnea; fatigue; female; fever; human; hypertension; liver disease; lung development; lung infection; lung volume; major clinical study; male; myalgia; neoplasm; neurologic disease; self report; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; lung; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; pandemic; procedures; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; software; statistical model; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Child; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Multidetector Computed Tomography; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Software; Young Adult","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Springer","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green","Etiology, Diagnosis",32666395,"European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging",16676,"journal",2.117,"Q1",160,"Germany","Western Europe","1996-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q1); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q1)","66841b05bf28252174033ae054b3ce6e94015831",11,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85087915344",18,57192486235,"Zhang H.",31,31,2,4,7,75,60088188,"Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University","chn","China","Shaanxi",57034529900,"Zhang T.",2835,2502,1,27,19,240,60009533,"Husson University","usa","United States","ME",7,6,6,1.50,1836,"2020-11-23","2020-10-04","2020-07-13",0,108,0,1.5,1.5,0,"2020-07-14","2021-02-03","2020-9-24",21,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00259-020-04953-1.pdf",7

This virus was declared as Pandemic on 11th March 2020. Considering the massive growth rate in the number of cases and highly contagious nature of the virus, machine learning prediction models and algorithms are essential to predict the number of cases in the coming days. This could help in reducing the stress on health care systems and administrations by helping them plan better. In this paper the datasets used are obtained from the John Hopkins University's publicly available datasets to develop a state-of-the-art forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak. We have incorporated data-driven estimations and time series analysis to predict the trends in coming days such as the number of cases confirmed positive, number of deaths caused by the virus and number of people recovered from the novel coronavirus.

This study aimed at evaluating the layer depths and degree of fine-tuning on transfer learning with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based COVID-19 screening in CXR to identify efficient transfer learning strategies. The CXR images used in this study were collected from publicly available repositories, and the collected images were classified into three classes: COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. To evaluate the effect of layer depths of the same CNN architecture, CNNs called VGG-16 and VGG-19 were used as backbone networks. Then, each backbone network was trained with different degrees of fine-tuning and comparatively evaluated. The experimental results showed the highest AUC value to be 0.950 concerning COVID-19 classification in the experimental group of a fine-tuned with only 2/5 blocks of the VGG16 backbone network. In conclusion, in the classification of medical images with a limited number of data, a deeper layer depth may not guarantee better results. In addition, even if the same pre-trained CNN architecture is used, an appropriate degree of fine-tuning can help to build an efficient deep learning model. © 2020 by the authors.

The international community tries to find, apply, or design novel methods for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients as soon as possible. Currently, a reliable method for the diagnosis of infected patients is a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The method is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, designing novel methods is important. In this paper, we used three deep learning-based methods for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients with the use of X-Ray images of lungs. For the diagnosis of the disease, we presented two algorithms include deep neural network (DNN) on the fractal feature of images and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods with the use of the lung images, directly. Results classification shows that the presented CNN architecture with higher accuracy (93.2%) and sensitivity (96.1%) is outperforming than the DNN method with an accuracy of 83.4% and sensitivity of 86%. In the segmentation process, we presented a CNN architecture to find infected tissue in lung images. Results show that the presented method can almost detect infected regions with high accuracy of 83.84%. This finding also can be used to monitor and control patients from infected region growth. © 2020",2020,10,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, United States; Department of Industrial Engineering, Urmia University of Technology, Urmia, Iran; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Urmia University of Technology, Urmia, Iran","Artificial intelligence; Classification; CNN; COVID-19; DNN; Segmentation","Biological organs; Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Network architecture; Patient treatment; Polymerase chain reaction; Tissue; Detection and diagnosis; Infected patients; International community; Learning-based methods; Monitor and control; Results classifications; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Segmentation process; Convolutional neural networks","Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green",NULL,NULL,"Chaos, Solitons and Fractals",25347,"journal",1.036,"Q1",132,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","1991-2020","Applied Mathematics (Q1); Mathematics (miscellaneous) (Q1); Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous) (Q1); Statistical and Nonlinear Physics (Q1)","0de71197f817270dd17355b53b5ccf4bd2dc1ab8",9,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85088980389",3,57218368245,"Hassantabar S.",10,10,1,1,2,8,60003269,"Princeton University","usa","United States","NJ",57196236499,"Sharifi A.",162,134,14,6,5,14,60104370,"Urmia University of Technology","irn","Iran",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-07-29","2021-02-28","2020-11-28",34,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S096007792030566X?httpAccept=text/xml",7

It appears in November 2019 in Hubei province (in China), and more specifically in the city of Wuhan, then spreads in the whole world. As the number of cases increases with unprecedented speed, many parts of the world are facing a shortage of resources and testing. Faced with this problem, physicians, scientists and engineers, including specialists in Artificial Intelligence (AI), have encouraged the development of a Deep Learning model to help healthcare professionals to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images and to determine the severity of the infection in a very short time, with low cost. In this paper, we propose CVDNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify COVID-19 infection from normal and other pneumonia cases using chest X-ray images. The proposed architecture is based on the residual neural network and it is constructed by using two parallel levels with different kernel sizes to capture local and global features of the inputs. This model is trained on a dataset publically available containing a combination of 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal and 1345 viral pneumonia chest x-ray images. The experimental results reveal that our CVDNet. These results represent a promising classification performance on a small dataset which can be further achieve better results with more training data. Overall, our CVDNet model can be an interesting tool to help radiologists in the diagnosis and early detection of COVID-19 cases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,5,"Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science and Technology of Fez S.M.B.

This study presents the perspective of different modes of transmission of coronavirus,especially during clinical practices and among the pediatrics. Further, the diagnostic methods and the advancement of the computerized tomography have been discussed. Droplets, aerosol, and close contact are thesignificantfactors to transfer the infection to the suspect. This study predicts the possible transmission of the virus through medical practices such as ophthalmology, dental, and endoscopy procedures. With regard to pediatric transmission, as of now, only afew child fatalities had been reported. Childrenusually respond to the respiratory virus; however, COVID-19 response ison the contrary. The possibility of getting infected is minimal for the newborn. There has been no asymptomatic spread in children until now. Moreover, breastfeedingwould not transmit COVID-19, which is encouraging hygiene news for the pediatric.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 10, 2020, to February 18, 2020. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province were included, retrospectively. Quantitative CT measurements of pulmonary opacities including volume, density, and location were extracted by deep learning algorithm. Dynamic evolution of these measurements was investigated from symptom onset (day 1) to beyond day 15. Comparison was made between severity groups. Results: A total of 484 patients (median age of 47 years, interquartile range 33–57) with 954 CT examinations were included, and each was assigned to one of the three groups: asymptomatic/mild (n = 63), moderate (n = 378), severe/critically ill (n = 43). Time series showed different evolution patterns of CT measurements in the groups. Following disease onset, posteroinferior subpleural area of the lung was the most common location for pulmonary opacities. Opacity volume continued to increase beyond 15 days in the severe/critically ill group, compared with peaking on days 13–15 in the moderate group. Asymptomatic/mild group had the lowest opacity volume which almost resolved after 15 days. The opacity density began to drop from day 10 to day 12 for moderately ill patients. Conclusions: Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity and their evolution on CT varied with disease severity in COVID-19. These findings are valuable in understanding the nature of the disease and monitoring the patient’s condition during the course of illness. Key Points: • Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity on CT change over time in COVID-19. • The evolution of CT appearance follows specific pattern, varying with disease severity. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.",2020,5,"Department of Radiology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, 87 Ding Jia Qiao Road, Nanjing, 210009, China; Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, L3 5QA, United Kingdom; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China; School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China; Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong","Coronavirus; Multidetector computed tomography; Viral pneumonia","aspartate aminotransferase; C reactive protein; D dimer; lactate dehydrogenase; adult; Article; China; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; deep learning; disease severity; female; fever; human; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; platelet count; priority journal; retrospective study; sputum; Betacoronavirus; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; critical illness; diagnostic imaging; lung; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; severity of illness index; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiography, Thoracic; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Springer","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",NULL,32524223,"European Radiology",16687,"journal",1.579,"Q1",143,"Germany","Western Europe","1991-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q1); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q1)","98fa0c8849b31e3a5b00d99d6b7600aba838310e",15,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85086398608",12,56147676100,"Wang Y.",237,221,2,9,8,88,60000065,"School of Medicine, Southeast University","chn","China","Jiangsu",12778714800,"Ju S.",2206,1881,1,27,19,441,60000065,"School of Medicine, Southeast University","chn","China","Jiangsu",11,9,10,4.10,1598,"2020-06-18","2020-06-12","2020-06-09",0,94,0,4.1,0,0,"2020-06-10","2021-03-15","2020-10-13",24,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00330-020-06976-6.pdf",8

Results: Among 332 patients (male:female, 173:159; mean age, 57 years) with available rRT-PCR results, 16 patients (4.8%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Using CXR, radiologists with CAD assistance identified rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients with sensitivity and specificity of 68.8% and 66.7%, respectively. Among 119 patients (male:female, 75:44; mean age, 69 years) with available chest CTs, radiologists assisted by CAD reported pneumonia on CXR with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 72.3%. The TATs of CXR reports were significantly shorter than those of rRT-PCR results (median 51 vs. 507 minutes; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Radiologists with CAD assistance could identify patients with rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 or pneumonia on CXR with a reasonably acceptable performance. In patients suspected with COVID-19, CXR had much faster TATs than rRT-PCRs. © 2020 The Korean Society of Radiology.",2020,6,"Department of Radiology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea","COVID-19; COVID-19 diagnostic testing; Deep learning; Pneumonia; Radiography, thoracic","adult; aged; Article; computer aided design; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; lung nodule; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; pneumonia; pneumothorax; predictive value; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; turnaround time; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiography, Thoracic; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Korean Radiological Society","Korean Radiological Society","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",NULL,32729263,"Korean Journal of Radiology",17255,"journal",0.885,"Q1",53,"South Korea","Asiatic Region","2000-2020","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q1)","e401eed62efe5dd378cf94046bc31079cbf437c9",6,0,1,1,1,"2-s2.0-85090040425",5,56018603700,"Hwang E.",615,526,2,14,9,129,60021119,"Seoul National University Hospital","kor","South Korea",NULL,16234023200,"Park C.",5102,3623,1,39,22,345,60000656,"Seoul National University College of Medicine","kor","South Korea",NULL,17,13,13,6.05,1156,"2020-11-23","2020-08-01","2019-12-31",0,68,0,6.05,5.55,0,"2020-07-20","2021-02-19","2020-8-27",30,"https://kjronline.org/pdf/10.3348/kjr.2020.0536",7

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ( ± 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates.

It spreads rapidly through close contact with somebody who is infected or tapping or holding a virus contaminated objects and surfaces. Another infectious illness known as Pneumonia is often caused by infection due to a bacterium in the alveoli of lungs. When an infected tissue of the lungs has inflammation, it builds-up pus in it. To find out if the patient has these diseases, experts conduct physical exams and diagnose their patients through Chest X-ray, ultrasound, or biopsy of lungs. Misdiagnosis, inaccurate treatment, and if the disease is ignored will lead to the patient's loss of life. The progression of Deep Learning contributes to aid in the decision-making process of experts to diagnose patients with these diseases. The study employs a flexible and efficient approach of deep learning applying the model of CNN in predicting and detecting a patient unaffected and affected with the disease employing a chest X-ray image. The studyutilized a collected dataset of 20,000 images using a 224x224 image resolution with 32 batch size is applied to prove the performance of the CNN model being trained. The trained-model produced an accuracy rate of 95% during the performance training.

Meanwhile, lungs are also vulnerable and are easily damaged by inflammation or impact lesions during the course of our daily lives. Due to the epidemic of COVID-19 pneumonia, the confirmed and suspected cases often grow rapidly beyond the capabilities of medical institutions, rapid and accurate diagnosis for patients have become the first priority. Hence, ultrasound images have started to be adopted in lung diagnosis as they are more convenient, flexible, cheaper, and without ionizing radiation as compared with CT and CXR. This paper aims to use VGG, ResNet and EfficientNet networks to accurately classify Lung Ultrasound images of pneumonia according to different clinical stages based on self-made LUS datasets. The hyperparameters of the three networks were tuned and their performances were carefully compared. Our results indicate that the EfficientNet model outperformed the others, providing the best classification accuracies for 3 and 4 clinical stages of pneumonia are 94.62% and 91.18%, respectively. The best classification accuracy of 8 imagological features of pneumonia is 82.75%.

Structure-based VS relies on scoring functions which aim to evaluate the binding of a candidate compound (ligand) on a protein target. Over the last few years, the advancement of the deep learning field has led to the development of novel scoring functions based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which have achieved state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we present an integrated end-to-end VS pipeline for application on real-world drug discovery scenarios. It combines multiple conformations of the ligand with a new CNN scoring function based on the ResNet architecture, called ResNetVS, which incorporates also the docking output score in its evaluation. After experiments on the DUD-E dataset, it has shown notable performance, especially in early enrichment, where it overcomes current benchmarks. The proposed pipeline is finally applied on the emerging case of COVID-19 pandemic, in a struggle to discover inhibitors for the viral spike protein-ACE2 interaction. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,0,"Information Technologies Institute, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece; Institute of Chemical Biology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece","covid-19; deep learning; ResNetVS; scoring function; virtual screening","Benchmarking; Bioinformatics; Convolutional neural networks; Database systems; Diseases; E-learning; Function evaluation; Ligands; Pipelines; Proteins; Virtual reality; Computational approach; Ligand compounds; Multiple conformations; Protein targets; Scoring functions; State of the art; Time-consuming procedure; Virtual Screening; Deep learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","",NULL,NULL,"Proceedings - IEEE 20th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering, BIBE 2020",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"63eb3e047187abdb3c37c2a6532299a675331c8b",0,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85099595533",7,55413542500,"Mylonas S.",61,52,2,4,9,35,60026208,"Center For Research And Technology - Hellas","grc","Greece","Macedonia",6602644373,"Daras P.",2378,1944,34,27,20,495,60026208,"Center For Research And Technology - Hellas","grc","Greece","Macedonia",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-12-17","2021-02-18","2021-2-18",47,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9287816/9287978/09288044.pdf?arnumber=9288044",2

Methods: This retrospective study consisted of 5,766 persons-under-investigation for COVID-19 between 7 February 2020 and 4 May 2020. Demographics, chronic comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms and laboratory tests at admission were collected. A deep neural network model and a risk-score system were constructed to predict ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Prediction performance used the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC). Results: The top ICU predictors were procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and oxygen saturation. The top mortality predictors were age, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein and oxygen saturation. Age and troponin were unique top predictors for mortality but not ICU admission. The deep-learning model predicted ICU admission and mortality with an AUC of 0.780 (95% CI [0.760-0.785]) and 0.844 (95% CI [0.839-0.848]), respectively. The corresponding risk scores yielded an AUC of 0.728 (95% CI [0.726-0.729]) and 0.848 (95% CI [0.847-0.849]), respectively.

Recurrent neural network (RNN) based long-short term memory (LSTM) variants such as Deep LSTM, Convolutional LSTM and Bi-directional LSTM are applied on Indian dataset to predict the number of positive cases. LSTM model with minimum error is chosen for predicting daily and weekly cases. It is observed that the proposed method yields high accuracy for short term prediction with error less than 3% for daily predictions and less than 8% for weekly predictions. Indian states are categorised into different zones based on the spread of positive cases and daily growth rate for easy identification of novel coronavirus hot-spots.

Currently detection of coronovirus depends on factors like the patients' signs and symptoms, location where the person lives, travelling history and close contact with any COVID-19 patient. In order to test a COVID-19 patient, a healthcare provider uses a long swab to take a nasal sample. The sample is then tested in a laboratory setting. If person is coughing up then the saliva (sputum), is emitted for testing. The diagnosis becomes even more critical when there is a lack of reagents or testing capacity, tracking the virus and its severity and coming in contact with COVID-19 positive patients by a healthcare practitioner. In this scenario of COVID-19 pendamic, there is a need of streaming diagnosis based on retrospective study of laboratory data in form of chest X-rays using deep learning. This paper proposed a demystify technique to detect COVID-19 using assembling medical images with the help of deep nets. The study shows promising results with accuracy of 91.67% for diagnosis of COVID-19 and 100\% accuracy in proving the survival ratio. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,0,"Computer Science Department, University of POLITEHNICA Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; DIIES Department University Mediterranea of Reggio, Calabria, Italy; Electronics Department Universiti of Teknologi Malaysia, Johar Bahru, Malaysia","Chest X-ray images; Convolution neural network; Covid-19; Deep learning","Deep learning; Health care; Medical imaging; Viruses; Chest X-ray image; Chest x-rays; Coronaviruses; Health care providers; Infectious disease; Laboratory datum; Robust technique; Survival ratio; Diagnosis","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","",NULL,NULL,"2020 8th E-Health and Bioengineering Conference, EHB 2020",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,"2-s2.0-85098857326",3,57208174791,"Channa A.",13,13,8,2,3,11,60003161,"University Politehnica of Bucharest","rou","Romania","Bucharest",57221337179,"Ur Rehman Malik N.",0,0,1,0,1,2,114308499,"Electronics Department Universiti of Teknologi Malaysia","mys","Malaysia",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-10-29","2020-12-10",NULL,NULL,NULL,4

The impact of COVID-19 has been fallen on almost all sectors of development. The healthcare system is going through a crisis. Many precautionary measures have been taken to reduce the spread of this disease where wearing a mask is one of them. In this paper, we propose a system that restrict the growth of COVID-19 by finding out people who are not wearing any facial mask in a smart city network where all the public places are monitored with Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras. While a person without a mask is detected, the corresponding authority is informed through the city network. A deep learning architecture is trained on a dataset that consists of images of people with and without masks collected from various sources. The trained architecture achieved 98.7% accuracy on distinguishing people with and without a facial mask for previously unseen test data. It is hoped that our study would be a useful tool to reduce the spread of this communicable disease for many countries in the world. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,0,"Khulna University of Engineering Technology, Computer Science and Engineering, Khulna, 9203, Bangladesh; Kent State University, Advanced Telerobotics Research Lab, Kent, OH, United States","Convolutional Neural Network; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Facial Mask Detection; Smart City","Automation; Deep learning; Face recognition; Internet of things; Smart city; Television networks; Wear of materials; Automated systems; Closed circuit television; Communicable disease; Coronaviruses; Health-care system; Learning architectures; Precautionary measures; Public places; Network architecture","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,"","IEMTRONICS 2020 - International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference, Proceedings",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"68f925612681ffda59c9f3e225bf333d8c221d14",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096355672",5,57216691397,"Rahman M.",0,0,1,0,3,9,60033059,"University of Chittagong","bgd","Bangladesh",NULL,55808026200,"Kim J.",197,182,41,7,14,82,60029653,"Kent State University","usa","United States","OH",1,1,1,1.00,570,"2020-11-24","2020-11-24","2020-08-31",0,38,0,1,1,0,"2020-10-08","2020-10-21","2020-10-21",23,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9211388/9216328/09216386.pdf?arnumber=9216386",4

This virus causes respiratory disease (for instance, flu) with symptoms such as cough, fever and, in severe cases, pneumonia. The test to detect the presence of this virus in humans is performed on sputum or blood samples and the outcome is generally available within a few hours or, at most, days. Analysing biomedical imaging the patient shows signs of pneumonia. In this paper, with the aim of providing a fully automatic and faster diagnosis, we propose the adoption of deep learning for COVID-19 detection from X-rays. Method: In particular, we propose an approach composed by three phases: the first one to detect if in a chest X-ray there is the presence of a pneumonia. The second one to discern between COVID-19 and pneumonia. The last step is aimed to localise the areas in the X-ray symptomatic of the COVID-19 presence. Results and Conclusion: Experimental analysis on 6,523 chest X-rays belonging to different institutions demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with an average time for COVID-19 detection of approximately 2.5 seconds and an average accuracy equal to 0.97. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,31,"Department of Medicine and Health Sciences “Vincenzo Tiberio”, University of Molise, Campobasso, Italy; Institute for Informatics and Telematics, National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Pisa, Italy; Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli”, Napoli, Italy; Department of Biosciences and Territory, University of Molise, Pesche (IS), Italy","Artificial intelligence; Chest; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Deep learning; Transfer learning","Diagnosis; Medical imaging; Pulmonary diseases; Viruses; X rays; Biomedical imaging; Blood samples; Chest x-rays; Coronaviruses; Experimental analysis; Infectious disease; Three phasis; Deep learning; Article; blood sampling; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; false negative result; human; lung disease; major clinical study; symptom; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; image processing; pandemic; procedures; reproducibility; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; X ray; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung Diseases; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiography, Thoracic; Reproducibility of Results; X-Rays","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","No","Diagnosis",32599338,"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine",23604,"journal",0.946,"Q1",92,"Ireland","Western Europe","1985-2020","Computer Science Applications (Q1); Health Informatics (Q1); Software (Q1)","fa94636019dc67fb5a03ffb569cecd50386c2301",55,0,7,0,1,"2-s2.0-85086819887",4,7003807892,"Brunese L.",2821,1801,44,33,30,619,60014096,"Università degli Studi del Molise","ita","Italy","CB",6603700255,"Santone A.",1347,588,1,23,26,90,60014096,"Università degli Studi del Molise","ita","Italy","CB",2,2,2,0.50,4484,"2020-11-30","2020-11-30","2020-10-31",0,236,0,0.5,0.5,0,"2020-06-21","2021-03-15","2020-10-21",53,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0169260720314413?httpAccept=text/xml",8

Such platforms provide users with interactive options such as likes, dislikes as well as a way of expressing their opinions in the form of text (i.e., comments). The ability of posting comments on these online platforms has allowed some users to post racist, obscene, as well as to spread hate on these platforms. In some cases, this kind of toxic behavior might turn the comment section from a space where users can share their views to a place where hate and profanity are spread. Such issues are observed across various social media platforms and many users are often exposed to these kinds of behaviors which requires comment moderators to spend a lot of time filtering out such inappropriate comments. Moreover, such textual ""inappropriate contents"" can be targeted towards users irrespective of age, concerning variety of topics (not only controversial), and triggered by various events. My doctoral dissertation work, therefore, is primarily focused on studying, detecting and analyzing users exposure to this kind of toxicity on different social media platforms utilizing the state-of-art techniques in deep learning and natural language processing. This paper presents one example of my works on detecting and measuring kids exposure to inappropriate comments posted on YouTube videos targeting young users.

A huge number of people from most of the countries are infected within six months from its first report of appearance and it keeps spreading. The required systems are not ready up to some stages for any pandemic; therefore, mitigation with existing capacity becomes necessary. On the other hand, modern-era largely depends on Artificial Intelligence(AI) including Data Science; and Deep Learning(DL) is one of the current flag-bearer of these techniques. It could use to mitigate COVID-19 like pandemics in terms of stop spread, diagnosis of the disease, drug & vaccine discovery, treatment, patient care, and many more. But this DL requires large datasets as well as powerful computing resources. A shortage of reliable datasets of a running pandemic is a common phenomenon. So, Deep Transfer Learning(DTL) would be effective as it learns from one task and could work on another task. In addition, Edge Devices(ED) such as IoT, Webcam, Drone, Intelligent Medical Equipment, Robot, etc. are very useful in a pandemic situation. These types of equipment make the infrastructures sophisticated and automated which helps to cope with an outbreak. But these are equipped with low computing resources, so, applying DL is also a bit challenging; therefore, DTL also would be effective there. This article scholarly studies the potentiality and challenges of these issues. It has described relevant technical backgrounds and reviews of the related recent state-of-the-art.

Correct facemask wearing is valuable for infectious disease control, but the effectiveness of facemasks has been diminished, mostly due to improper wearing. However, there have not been any published reports on the automatic identification of facemask-wearing conditions. In this study, we develop a new facemask-wearing condition identification method by combining image super-resolution and classification networks (SRCNet), which quantifies a three-category classification problem based on unconstrained 2D facial images. The proposed algorithm contains four main steps: Image pre-processing, facial detection and cropping, image super-resolution, and facemask-wearing condition identification. Our method was trained and evaluated on the public dataset Medical Masks Dataset containing 3835 images with 671 images of no facemask-wearing, 134 images of incorrect facemask-wearing, and 3030 images of correct facemask-wearing.

This is attributed to the unavoidable delay in the diagnosis process, due to limitation of COVID-19 test kits. Thus, it is urgently required to establish more cheap and affordable diagnostic approaches. Chest X-ray is an important initial step towards a successful COVID-19 diagnose, where it is easily to detect any chest abnormalities (e.g., lung inflammation). Furthermore, majority of hospitals have X-ray devices that can be used in early COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the shortage of radiologists is a key factor that limits early COVID-19 diagnosis and negatively affects the treatment process. This paper presents an artificial intelligence based technique for early COVID-19 diagnosis from chest X-ray images using medical knowledge and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To this end, a deep learning model is built carefully and fine-tuned to achieve the maximum performance in COVID-19 detection. Experimental results on recent benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique in identifying COVID-19 with 96% accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,0,"South Valley University, Faculty of Commerce, Qena, Egypt; South Valley University, Faculty of Computers and Information, Departement of Computer Science, Qena, Egypt","Artificial Intelligence; Chest X-ray; Convolutional Neural Networks; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Pneumonia","Benchmarking; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Medical imaging; Benchmark datasets; Chest X-ray image; Chest x-rays; Diagnostic approach; Learning models; Lung inflammation; Medical knowledge; Treatment process; Diagnosis","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,NULL,"2nd Novel Intelligent and Leading Emerging Sciences Conference, NILES 2020",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"f8be8567807a8e711893d054b28f16922c11b6fc",0,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85097952549",4,55932537300,"Bekhet S.",29,15,1,3,11,11,60018623,"South Valley University","egy","Egypt","Qena",57213688739,"Hameed M.",29,26,1,2,4,8,123515262,"Luxor University","egy","Egypt",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-11-18","2021-01-13","2021-1-13",29,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9257809/9257872/09257930.pdf?arnumber=9257930",3

Health resources in most countries are either insufficient or not fairly shared. There are various problems such as the number of health personnel, the number of beds, or the number of intensive care units. Using limited resources at the optimum level is the key to the country's health systems to overcome this epidemic. Disease detection is an important factor in preventing the epidemic. The higher the success, the more controlled the spread of the virus. Whether the person has a virus or not is usually done by the PCR test. In addition to the PCR method, chest X-ray images can be classified with deep learning methods. Deep learning methods have become popular in academic studies by processing multi-layered images in one go and by defining manually entered parameters in machine learning. This popularity reflected positively on limited health datasets. In this study, it was aimed to detect the disease of people whose X-rays were taken for suspected COVID-19. In such COVID-19 studies, a binary classification has generally been made. The data set includes chest X-rays of patients with COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and healthy patients. Before the classification process, the data augmentation method was applied to the data set.

Shelter-in-place (SIP) orders are implemented worldwide to reduce the proliferation rate of this virus. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed it as 'pandemic,' its emergent state prevails worldwide. As a successor of SARS-CoV-2, higher destruction has been enforced on human lives intolerably. However, the prior detection could help shorten this disease's proliferation rate; various prediction and diagnosis tools are useful with artificial intelligence. These tools might assist in preventive measures against the virus infection. The main objective of this article is two-folded. First, to explore the application of soft computing techniques, the overview of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), internet of things (IoT), and support vector machines (SVM) have been interpreted concerning COVID-19 analysis. Next, to analyze performance, a comparative study has been represented to show that the soft computing models outperform some of the prevailed analytical models on the COVID-19. Method: To forecast and predict a pandemic outbreak, Cauchy distribution probabilistic approaches are applied. An extensive study of mathematical and theoretical, and approximate models based on soft computing done for COVID-19 prediction. Consecutively, some curious factor such as infection rate based on age groups could be forecasted. Also, Sick rate, and immunity rate during the quarantine period have been analyzed for nearly 500 sample tests taken globally.

Recent studies show that radiological images like chest X-rays can offer a more efficient solution and faster initial screening of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we develop a COVID-19 diagnosis model using Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network (MLP-CNN) for mixed-data (numerical/categorical and image data). The model predicts and differentiates between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, such that early diagnosis of the virus can be initiated, leading to timely isolation and treatments to stop further spread of the disease. We also explore the benefits of using numerical/categorical data in association with chest X-ray images for screening COVID-19 patients considering both balanced and imbalanced datasets. Three different optimization algorithms are used and tested:adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm (Adam), stochastic gradient descent (Sgd), and root mean square propagation (Rmsprop). Preliminary computational results show that, on a balanced dataset, a model trained with Adam can distinguish between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with a higher accuracy of 96.3%. On the imbalanced dataset, the model trained with Rmsprop outperformed all other models by achieving an accuracy of 95.38%.

It is considered the supreme crisis of the present era and one of the most crucial hazards threatening worldwide health. Therefore, the early detection of COVID-19 is essential. The common way to detect COVID-19 is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, although it has several drawbacks. Computed tomography (CT) scans can enable the early detection of suspected patients, however, the overlap between patterns of COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia makes it difficult for radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 accurately. On the other hand, deep learning (DL) techniques and especially the convolutional neural network (CNN) can classify COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. In addition, DL techniques that use CT images can deliver an accurate diagnosis faster than the RT-PCR test, which consequently saves time for disease control and provides an efficient computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. The shortage of publicly available datasets of CT images, makes the CAD system’s design a challenging task. The CAD systems in the literature are based on either individual CNN or two-fused CNNs; one used for segmentation and the other for classification and diagnosis. In this article, a novel CAD system is proposed for diagnosing COVID-19 based on the fusion of multiple CNNs. First, an end-to-end classification is performed. Afterward, the deep features are extracted from each network individually and classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Next, principal component analysis is applied to each deep feature set, extracted from each network. Such feature sets are then used to train an SVM classifier individually. Afterward, a selected number of principal components from each deep feature set are fused and compared with the fusion of the deep features extracted from each CNN. The results show that the proposed system is effective and capable of detecting COVID-19 and distinguishing it from non-COVID-19 cases with an accuracy of 94.7%, AUC of 0.98 (98%), sensitivity 95.6%, and specificity of 93.7%. Moreover, the results show that the system is efficient, as fusing a selected number of principal components has reduced the computational cost of the final model by almost 32%.

Because of increasing number of cases day by day, it takes time to interpret the laboratory findings thus the limitations in terms of both treatment and findings are emerged. Due to such limitations, the need for clinical decisions making system with predictive algorithms has arisen. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying the diseases. In this study, we perform clinical predictive models that estimate, using deep learning and laboratory data, which patients are likely to receive a COVID-19 disease. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, precision, F1-score, recall, AUC, and accuracy scores calculated. Models were tested with 18 laboratory findings from 600 patients and validated with 10 fold cross-validation and train-test split approaches. The experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify patients that have COVID-19 disease at an accuracy of 86.66%, F1-score of 91.89%, precision of 86.75%, recall of 99.42%, and AUC of 62.50%. It is observed that predictive models trained on laboratory findings could be used to predict COVID-19 infection, and can be helpful for medical experts to prioritize the resources correctly.

For this reason, it has very devastating effects in many areas worldwide. It is vital to detect COVID-19 diseases as quickly as possible to restrain the spread of the disease. The similarity of COVID-19 disease with other lung infections makes the diagnosis difficult. In addition, the high spreading rate of COVID-19 increased the need for a fast system for the diagnosis of cases. For this purpose, interest in various computer-aided (such as CNN, DNN, etc.) deep learning models has been increased. In these models, mostly radiology images are applied to determine the positive cases. Recent studies show that, radiological images contain important information in the detection of coronavirus. In this study, a novel artificial neural network, Convolutional CapsNet for the detection of COVID-19 disease is proposed by using chest X-ray images with capsule networks. The proposed approach is designed to provide fast and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19 diseases with binary classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings), and multi-class classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings, and Pneumonia). The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.24%, and 84.22% for binary class, and multi-class, respectively. It is thought that the proposed method may help physicians to diagnose COVID-19 disease and increase the diagnostic performance.

Because past research on antecedents of unethical behavior has not provided a clear answer, we turned to machine learning to generate novel hypotheses. We trained a deep-learning model to predict whether or not World Values Survey respondents perceived unethical behaviors as justifiable, on the basis of their responses to 708 other items. The model identified optimism about the future of humanity as one of the top predictors of unethicality. A preregistered correlational study (N = 218 U.S. residents) conceptually replicated this finding. A preregistered experiment (N = 294 U.S. residents) provided causal support: Participants who read a scenario conveying optimism about the COVID-19 pandemic were less willing to justify hoarding and violating social-distancing guidelines than participants who read a scenario conveying pessimism.

Imaging analysis based on computed tomography (CT) data is an important means of clinical diagnosis. A supercomputing-supported method is proposed for the construction of a new comprehensive CT analysis auxiliary system dealing with pneumonia. Method: The system consists of four parts: input processing module, preprocessing module, imaging analysis subsystem, and artificial intelligence(AI) analysis subsystem. Among the four parts, the imaging analysis subsystem detects the pneumonia features, distinguishes typical new coronary pneumonia by analyzing the typical imaging features, such as lung consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and crazy-paving pattern, and then comes to a conclusion of pneumonia. The AI analysis subsystem uses a deep learning model to classify typical viral pneumonia and COVID-19, which enhances the screening ability of pneumonia. Convolutional neural network is widely used as an effective algorithm for medical image analysis, particularly in image classification. It is also widely utilized in the CT image screening and has achieved good results, which has attracted the attention of domestic and foreign scholars and industry. The seasonable result derived from deep learning relies largely on the number and quality of training samples. Given the lack of training samples, the system selects transfer learning as the technical direction for model construction. Considering the quick response to the epidemic, the quality of easy maintenance and dynamic system updating is required. Thus, after comparing and analyzing the performance and classification effect indexes of many common image classification models, we build a transfer learning neural network model on the basis of inception. The entire neural network can be roughly divided into two parts: the first part uses a pre-trained inception network; the role of which is to convert image data into a one-dimensional feature vector. The second part uses a fully connected network to improve classification prediction. The imaging analysis method analyzes the image features of COVID-19, extracts the pneumonia feature areas, and carries out semantic analysis to achieve the delineation of the pneumonia target area. Simultaneously, the typical imaging characteristics of COVID-19 (such as ground glass shadow, infiltration shadow, and lung consolidation) are targeted. With regard to the pneumonia target area, a multi-level dynamic threshold segmentation is first used to determine the minimum lung tissue area (rectangular region of interest (ROI)). The extraction of the lung tissue area is designed as a normal workflow. For each ROI, pixel statistics, threshold segmentation, regional dissolution and expansion, and abnormal proofreading are used to obtain the pneumonia target area. Aiming at the relationship between the sizes of the pneumonia target area, a logical filter is established to detect the segmented distribution features and spatial relationship with the outer contour of the lung. Then, based on the characteristic relationship of typical new coronary pneumonia, the typical characteristics of new coronary pneumonia are outlined. The entire comprehensive analysis platform is built on the basis of the Tianhe artificial intelligence innovation-integrated platform. The Tianhe artificial intelligence innovation-integrated platform is based on the hardware fusion supporting the environment of Tianhe supercomputing, cloud computing, and big data, upon which realizes the existing mainstream deep learning framework. It is highly encapsulated with the processing model algorithm, forming a visual interactive template development environment covering multiple links such as data loading, model construction, training, verification, and solidified deployment. As a service on this supporting platform, CT image comprehensive analysis AI auxiliary system has access to the computing resources, data resources, and external service capabilities of the platform and finally achieves the rapid integration and dynamic update of the system during the pandemic. Result: After its release, the system has continuously and steadily provided new COVID-19 auxiliary diagnostic services and scientific research support for more than 30 hospitals and more than 100 scientific research institutions at home and abroad, providing important support for combating the epidemic. Conclusion: The supercomputing-supported new coronary pneumonia CT image comprehensive analysis auxiliary system construction method proposed in this paper has achieved important application on diagnosis and research. It is an effective way to achieve rapid deployment services and provide efficient support for emergencies. The system applies artificial intelligence technology using CT imaging to screen for COVID-19. By applying artificial intelligence to the screening of COVID-19 with pneumonia and giving reference opinions for auxiliary diagnosis, the marking and area statistics of the inflammatory regions are improved. The system achieves the combination of artificial intelligence traditional machine vision and deep learning technology to distinguish COVID-19 by using CT images. The combined route of viral pneumonitis feature extraction based on traditional machine vision and the COVID-19 image classification based on artificial intelligence technology has achieved a comprehensive analysis of medical image features and COVID-19 screening. The fast implementation mode of the fusion platform scenario is based on computing power and data support. Relying on the Tianhe artificial intelligence innovation-integrated service platform, the platform supports intelligent frontier innovation on the basis of computing power and data, implements an open model of simultaneous research and application, and has a multi-industry training resource model library and large-scale distributed training sources. With regard to rapid deployment and other service capabilities, this comprehensive analysis system is also the first public COVID-19 AI-assisted diagnostic system deployed online. Analysis based directly on digital imaging and communications in medicine(DICOM) data and video data will effectively improve the analysis efficiency, but it will involve data ethics and security-related issues; however, it is the developing direction that needs to be resolved in the future. © 2020, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

However, their use in medical computer vision tasks faces several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations through application to the pandemic-caused need for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution highlights significant benefits obtained through (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance over individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages for validating results; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; and, (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We find that ensemble approaches markedly improved classification and localization performance, and that inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helps guide algorithm design and parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct ensembles, perform ensemble-based disease ROI localization, and analyze inter-reader variability and algorithm performance for COVID-19 detection in CXRs.

Close interaction with a person infected or through touching a contaminated surface and object can spread the virus rapidly. As of now, there is no vaccine to combat the COVID-19, and the best way to protect the person from a virus is to avoid being exposed to it. Wearing a facemask that covers the nose and mouth in a public setting and repeatedly cleansing of hands or the use of at least 70% alcohol-based disinfectants is a practice to avoid virus exposure. Deep Learning technology has demonstrated its achievement in recognition and classification by processingimages. The research study uses deep learning techniques that identify if the person is wearing a facemask or not and check if the persons in the area observe physical distancing. The collected image data contains 20,000 images, uniformly crop images in 224x224 pixels, and attained an accuracy rate of 97% during the training of the model. The developed system is implemented using Python and OpenCV through TensorFlow that recognizes persons wearing a facemask or not wearing and measures the physical distance between each person. It signals an alarm and captures facial images upon detecting persons not wearing a mask and does not observe physical distancing.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction swab test as a diagnostic tool to confirm COVID-19 cases. This test requires at least a day for the results to come out depending on the available facilities. Many countries have adopted a targeted approach in screening potential patients due to the cost. However, there is a need for a fast and accurate screening test to complement this targeted approach, so that the potential virus carriers can be quarantined as early as possible. The X-ray is a good screening modality; it is quick at capturing, cheap, and widely available, even in third world countries. Therefore, a deep learning approach has been proposed to automate the screening process by introducing LightCovidNet, a lightweight deep learning model that is suitable for the mobile platform. It is important to have a lightweight model so that it can be used all over the world even on a standard mobile phone. The model has been trained with additional synthetic data that were generated from the conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network. LightCovidNet consists of three components, which are entry, middle, and exit flows. The middle flow comprises five units of feed-forward convolutional neural networks that are built using separable convolution operators. The exit flow is designed to improve the multi-scale capability of the network through a simplified spatial pyramid pooling module. It is a symmetrical architecture with three parallel pooling branches that enable the network to learn multi-scale features, which is suitable for cases wherein the X-ray images were captured from all over the world independently. Besides, the usage of separable convolution has managed to reduce the memory usage without affecting the classification accuracy. The proposed method managed to get the best mean accuracy of 0.9697 with a low memory requirement of just 841,771 parameters. Moreover, the symmetrical spatial pyramid pooling module is the most crucial component; the absence of this module will reduce the screening accuracy to just 0.9237. Hence, the developed model is suitable to be implemented for mass COVID-19 screening. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,4,"Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor, 43600, Malaysia; Community Health Department, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, 43400, Malaysia","COVID-19 screening; Feed-forward layer; Lightweight deep learning model; Separable convolution; Spatial pyramid pooling module","","MDPI AG","MDPI AG","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold",NULL,NULL,"Symmetry",21100201542,"journal",0.365,"Q2",36,"Switzerland","Western Europe","2009-2020","Chemistry (miscellaneous) (Q2); Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q2); Mathematics (miscellaneous) (Q3); Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous) (Q3)","6236940f91b098177d2a4b8eb5f02264c14f6569",3,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85091872523",3,36601656600,"Zulkifley M.",600,461,1,13,11,79,60001821,"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia","mys","Malaysia","Selangor",57193251098,"Zulkifley N.",33,20,8,3,5,10,60025577,"Universiti Putra Malaysia","mys","Malaysia","Selangor",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-09-16","2020-10-17","2020-9-16",48,"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/9/1530/pdf",5

Meanwhile, the manifestations of COVID-19 as seen through computed tomography (CT) imaging show individual characteristics that differ from those of other types of viral pneumonia such as influenza-A viral pneumonia (IAVP). This study aimed to establish an early screening model to distinguish COVID-19 from IAVP and healthy cases through pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. A total of 618 CT samples were collected: 219 samples from 110 patients with COVID-19 (mean age 50 years; 63 (57.3%) male patients); 224 samples from 224 patients with IAVP (mean age 61 years; 156 (69.6%) male patients); and 175 samples from 175 healthy cases (mean age 39 years; 97 (55.4%) male patients). All CT samples were contributed from three COVID-19-designated hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China. First, the candidate infection regions were segmented out from the pulmonary CT image set using a 3D deep learning model. These separated images were then categorized into the COVID-19, IAVP, and irrelevant to infection (ITI) groups, together with the corresponding confidence scores, using a location-attention classification model. Finally, the infection type and overall confidence score for each CT case were calculated using the Noisy-OR Bayesian function. The experimental result of the benchmark dataset showed that the overall accuracy rate was 86.7% in terms of all the CT cases taken together. The deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early screening of COVID-19 patients and were demonstrated to be a promising supplementary diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.",2020,25,"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China; Department of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou, 325000, China; Department of Infectious Disease, The First People's Hospital of Wenling, Wenling, 317500, China; Artificial Intelligence Lab, Hangzhou AiSmartVision Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, 310012, China; Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China; Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery & Key Lab of Pancreatic Diseases Research of Zhejiang Province & The Innovation Centre for the Study of Pancreatic, Diseases of Zhejiang Province & Clinical Medical Research Center of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases in Zhejiang Province & Precision Innovation Center of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Diseases of Zhejiang University, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China","Computed tomography; COVID-19; Location-attention classification model","Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Polymerase chain reaction; Bayesian functions; Benchmark datasets; Classification models; Diagnostic methods; Individual characteristics; Learning techniques; Overall accuracies; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Deep learning","Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green","Etiology, Diagnosis",32837749,"Engineering",21100780794,"journal",1.077,"Q1",30,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","2015-2020","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous) (Q1); Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Energy Engineering and Power Technology (Q1); Engineering (miscellaneous) (Q1); Environmental Engineering (Q1); Materials Science (miscellaneous) (Q1)","c235bcde238dfba6d08bfb082ef66af64a51c608",243,0,17,1,1,"2-s2.0-85087757499",21,55706237200,"Xu X.",1263,1190,14,13,21,208,60117819,"The State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases","chn","China","Zhejiang",55540790300,"Li L.",29949,25243,1,70,24,2239,60117819,"The State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases","chn","China","Zhejiang",4,3,3,1.00,6765,"2020-09-09","2020-07-14","2020-09-30",0,451,0,1,0,0,"2020-07-27",NULL,"",NULL,NULL,7

It is thus urgent to predict the development and spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we have developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 by using a deep learning method with rolling update mechanism based on the epidemical data provided by Johns Hopkins University. First, as traditional epidemical models use the accumulative confirmed cases for training, it can only predict a rising trend of the epidemic and cannot predict when the epidemic will decline or end, an improved model is built based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with daily confirmed cases training set. Second, considering the existing forecasting model based on LSTM can only predict the epidemic trend within the next 30 days accurately, the rolling update mechanism is embedded with LSTM for long-term projections. Third, by introducing Diffusion Index (DI), the effectiveness of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 is analyzed in our novel research. The trends of the epidemic in 150 days ahead are modeled for Russia, Peru and Iran, three countries on different continents. Under our estimation, the current epidemic in Peru is predicted to continue until November 2020. The number of positive cases per day in Iran is expected to fall below 1000 by mid-November, with a gradual downward trend expected after several smaller peaks from July to September, while there will still be more than 2000 increase by early December in Russia. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of preventive measures which have been taken by the government, which shows that the strict controlment can significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19. © 2020",2020,1,"School of Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Beijing, China; Technology Innovation Center for Territory Spatial Big-data, MNR of China, Beijing, China","Covid-19; Forecasting; LSTM; Modeling; Rolling update mechanism","Deep learning; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Learning systems; Diffusion indices; Forecasting modeling; Johns hopkins universities; Learning methods; Preventive measures; Social isolation; Time series prediction; Update mechanisms; Long short-term memory","Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green","Prognosis",NULL,"Chaos, Solitons and Fractals",25347,"journal",1.036,"Q1",132,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","1991-2020","Applied Mathematics (Q1); Mathematics (miscellaneous) (Q1); Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous) (Q1); Statistical and Nonlinear Physics (Q1)","f0451d9001d8a7538c02a22e03c5335e1519d75e",3,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85089702845",5,57216413976,"Wang P.",29,29,4,2,1,9,60009409,"China University of Geosciences, Beijing","chn","China",NULL,57217583967,"Zhu B.",28,28,3,2,1,7,60009409,"China University of Geosciences, Beijing","chn","China",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-08-19","2020-12-02","2020-11-28",21,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S096007792030610X?httpAccept=text/xml",6

Being used in many scenarios, simulators have collaborated for research in machine learning, deep learning and training of professionals. Nowadays, with the Covid-19 pandemic and social distancing, simulators have great potential as a tool to help in the teaching of robotics. However, research indicates that the user may encounter differences between what happens in the simulator and in real life, this effect is called reality gap. This article aims to investigate the effects of this gap in an educational robotics simulator, named Virtual Robotics Toolkit (VRT), as well as its impacts on the testing of algorithms and to propose strategies to reduce the impact of this effect. Three batch tests were carried out on two different robots, both in the simulation and in the real world. By capturing data from sensors such as tachometer, infrared, gyroscope and a light sensor, it was possible to compare the performance in the two scenarios and their differences.

The medical industry has seen a sharp growth since the past few decades and it has benefited thousands of living beings. Skin being the largest part of human beings, it has never been given the proper care nor importance, hence widely resulting in the ignorance of skin infections or cancers. Despite the diagnosis of several such diseases being detected at the later or critical stages, there is a little to no scope of detection where the affected people can identify the symptoms immediately and could reach a physician. In this paper, we present the development of a model using deep learning approach to identify the specific dermatitis and a mobile application that functions in a way to detect the disease when a picture of the symptomatic part is taken and uploaded. This scheme assists the medical professionals and patients during pandamic situations like COVID 19.

Up to now, the medicine and the vaccination for curing the COVID-19 are not yet available. Since the vaccine and medication of COVID-19 are not yet available, the government in many countries are strongly socialising three kinds of new practices. The new habits are physical distancing, wearing a mask, and handwashing frequently. This paper focuses on assessing the completeness of handwashing. The handwashing frames are extracted from a video clip. The frames are then categorised into six-movement steps by using a deep learning-based algorithm. The frame of hand object is separated from the video by applying skin colour differentiation. Two kinds of experiments based on two different video sources are performed in the paper.

Social distancing monitoring by using computer vision becomes an important technological aspect in the current pandemic. This type of technology ensures automatic human object detection followed by physical distance measurement. The actual distances are measured as the number of pixels separating two centroids. The social distancing violations are known based on the measured distances. In this works, we compare three deep learning methods used for social distancing monitoring i.e YOLOv3, YOLOv3-Tiny, and MobileNetSSD. Those methods are executed with and without GPU support, and we assess the their performances in terms of speed and detection accuracies. The results show that the use of GPU significantly increases the speed of both YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-Tiny, but not for MobilenetSSD. GPU support increases about 300 % the Frame-per-Second (FPS) rate of YOLOv3 and the highest FPS rate is achieved for YOLOv3-Tiny. The results also indicate that YOLOv3 offers the best detection accuracies compared to YOLOv3-Tiny and MobilenetSSD, but in the exchange of heavy computational process. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,0,"Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Research Center for Physics, Tangerang Selatan, Indonesia","computer vision; deep learning; graphical processing unit; social distancing","Deep learning; Learning systems; Object detection; Radar; Actual distance; Computational process; Detection accuracy; Graphical processing unit (GPUs); Learning methods; Technological aspects; Type of technology; Graphics processing unit","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","",NULL,NULL,"Proceeding - 2020 International Conference on Radar, Antenna, Microwave, Electronics and Telecommunications, ICRAMET 2020",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"90087c6e51e9a29b979ab2d700c0a629b7fe095a",0,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85099342657",6,57205724787,"Suryadi S.",0,0,2,0,2,13,60069394,"Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia","idn","Indonesia","Java",57218793124,"Purwowibowo P.",1,1,4,1,1,10,60069394,"Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia","idn","Indonesia","Java",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-12-25","2021-02-23","2021-2-23",19,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9298549/9298568/09298574.pdf?arnumber=9298574",2

Methods: A deep learning algorithm consisted of lesion detection, segmentation, and location was trained and validated in 14,435 participants with chest CT images and definite pathogen diagnosis. The algorithm was tested in a non-overlapping dataset of 96 confirmed COVID-19 patients in three hospitals across China during the outbreak. Quantitative detection performance of the model was compared with three radiological residents with two experienced radiologists’ reading reports as reference standard by assessing the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Results: Of 96 patients, 88 had pneumonia lesions on CT images and 8 had no abnormities on CT images. For per-patient basis, the algorithm showed superior sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 1.00) and F1 score of 0.97 in detecting lesions from CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. While for per-lung lobe basis, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98) and a slightly inferior F1 score of 0.86. The median volume of lesions calculated by algorithm was 40.10 cm3. An average running speed of 20.3 s ± 5.8 per case demonstrated the algorithm was much faster than the residents in assessing CT images (all p &lt; 0.017). The deep learning algorithm can also assist radiologists make quicker diagnosis (all p &lt; 0.0001) with superior diagnostic performance. Conclusions: The algorithm showed excellent performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT images compared with resident radiologists. Key Points: • The higher sensitivity of deep learning model in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia were found compared with radiological residents on a per-lobe and per-patient basis. • The deep learning model improves diagnosis efficiency by shortening processing time. • The deep learning model can automatically calculate the volume of the lesions and whole lung. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.",2020,12,"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu  210002, China; Department of Medical Imaging, Taihe Hospital, Shiyan, Hubei  442008, China; Department of Medical Imaging, Wuhan First Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei  430022, China; Deepwise AI Lab, Beijing, 100080, China; School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, 10080, China; Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong; Department of Medical Imaging, Medical Imaging Center, Nanjing Clinical School, Southern Medical University, 305 Zhongshan East Road, Xuanwu District, Nanjing, Jiangsu  210002, China","COVID-19; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Multidetector computed tomography; Pneumonia","adult; Article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic radiologist; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; left lung; lung lobe; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; nonhuman; pneumonia; priority journal; retrospective study; right lung; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; China; clinical trial; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; lung; multicenter study; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Springer","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green","Diagnosis",32617690,"European Radiology",16687,"journal",1.579,"Q1",143,"Germany","Western Europe","1991-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q1); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q1)","2940afa28ef96aec091aef9c7cfb9f4c7743524a",21,0,1,1,1,"2-s2.0-85087461919",14,56982513600,"Ni Q.",1478,1364,11,17,7,205,60004667,"Medical School of Nanjing University","chn","China","Jiangsu",15040253200,"Zhang L.",4044,2965,17,34,13,619,60004667,"Medical School of Nanjing University","chn","China","Jiangsu",5,5,5,2.35,2057,"2020-11-17","2020-11-17","2020-07-01",0,121,0,2.35,2.35,0,"2020-07-02","2021-02-09","2020-11-2",29,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00330-020-07044-9.pdf",7

Considering the large amount of examinations in high case-load scenarios, an automated tool could facilitate and save critical time in the diagnosis and risk stratification of the disease. Methods: A novel deep learning derived machine learning (ML) classifier was developed using a simplified programming approach and an open source dataset consisting of 6868 chest CT images from 418 patients which was split into training and validation subsets. The diagnostic performance was then evaluated and compared to experienced radiologists on an independent testing dataset. Diagnostic performance metrics were calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. Operating points with high positive (>10) and low negative (<0.01) likelihood ratios to stratify the risk of COVID-19 being present were identified and validated. Results: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.956 (AUC) on an independent testing dataset of 90 patients. Both rule-in and rule out thresholds were identified and tested. At the rule-in operating point, sensitivity and specificity were 84.4 % and 93.3 % and did not differ from both radiologists (p > 0.05). At the rule-out threshold, sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (60 %) differed significantly from the radiologists (p < 0.05). Likelihood ratios and a Fagan nomogram provide prevalence independent test performance estimates. Conclusion: Accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 using a basic deep learning approach is feasible using open-source CT image data. In addition, the machine learning classifier provided validated rule-in and rule-out criteria could be used to stratify the risk of COVID-19 being present. © 2020",2020,1,"Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Deepinsights Study Group for Artificial Intelligence, Vienna, Austria; Department of Radiology, Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum Süd – Kaiser-Franz-Josef Spital, Vienna, Austria","Computed tomography; Coronavirus disease 2019; Deep learning","abscess; adult respiratory distress syndrome; allergic pneumonitis; Article; aspergillosis; aspiration pneumonia; atypical mycobacteriosis; bacterial pneumonia; bronchiolitis; computer assisted tomography; computer language; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cystic fibrosis; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; disease classification; drug induced disease; feasibility study; fibrosing alveolitis; giant cell; granulomatosis; histoplasmosis; human; injury; interstitial pneumonia; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Loeffler pneumonia; lung cancer; lung edema; lung hemorrhage; lung metastasis; lung mycosis; major clinical study; nomogram; organizing pneumonia; Pneumocystis pneumonia; prevalence; priority journal; radiologist; receiver operating characteristic; sarcoidosis; sensitivity and specificity; silicosis; stratified sample; time factor; validation process; virus pneumonia; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; lung; male; middle aged; procedures; reproducibility; x-ray computed tomography; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green","Diagnosis, Etiology",33190102,"European Journal of Radiology",16677,"journal",1.082,"Q1",109,"Ireland","Western Europe","1981-2020","Medicine (miscellaneous) (Q1); Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q1)","5a005d16ac7ea5167de3a0375c66ab4d7d89cc44",3,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85095948757",6,55736448000,"Javor D.",160,152,6,6,9,56,60011394,"Medizinische Universitat Wien","aut","Austria","Vienna",23396260600,"Baltzer P.",4190,2652,2,36,18,564,60011394,"Medizinische Universitat Wien","aut","Austria","Vienna",11,8,8,2.50,884,"2021-01-23","2020-11-16","2020-11-30",0,52,0,2.5,2.5,1.25,"2020-11-05","2021-02-24","2020-11-30",31,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0720048X20305921?httpAccept=text/xml",3

Twenty-seven prospective consecutive patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected to evaluate the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model. An external test was conducted in Qianjiang Central Hospital to estimate the system’s robustness. The model achieved a per-patient accuracy of 95.24% and a per-image accuracy of 98.85% in internal retrospective dataset. For 27 internal prospective patients, the system achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. In external dataset, it achieved an accuracy of 96%.

Computed tomography (CT) can provide important information in COVID-19, especially for patients with moderate to severe disease as well as those with worsening cardiopulmonary status. As an automatic tool, deep learning methods can be utilized to perform semantic segmentation of affected lung regions, which is important to establish disease severity and prognosis prediction. Both the extent and type of pulmonary opacities help assess disease severity. However, manually pixel-level multi-class labelling is time-consuming, subjective, and non-quantitative. In this article, we proposed a hybrid weak label-based deep learning method that utilize both the manually annotated pulmonary opacities from COVID-19 pneumonia and the patient-level disease-type information available from the clinical report. A UNet was firstly trained with semantic labels to segment the total infected region. It was used to initialize another UNet, which was trained to segment the consolidations with patient-level information using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, multi-institutional CT datasets from Iran, Italy, South Korea, and the United States were utilized. Results show that our proposed method can predict the infected regions as well as the consolidation regions with good correlation to human annotation. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,0,"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States; Mgh and Bwh Center for Clinical Data Science, Boston, MA, United States; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea; Department of Internal Medicine, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, South Korea; Radiologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Maggiore della Carità, Novara, Italy; Radiologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Policlinico di Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; Department of Radiology, Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan, Iran; Department of Radiology, Firoozgar Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran","Computed tomography; consolidation; COVID-19; deep learning; lung; segmentation; severity; weak label","Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Maximum principle; Opacity; Semantics; Disease severity; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Good correlations; Human annotations; Learning methods; Prognosis prediction; Semantic segmentation; Type information; Deep learning; Article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; expectation-maximization algorithm; false positive result; human; lung consolidation; lung disease; major clinical study; mathematical analysis; multidetector computed tomography; receiver operating characteristic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; semantic web; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; female; isolation and purification; male; procedures; retrospective study; severity of illness index; virology; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Etiology, Prognosis, Diagnosis",33044938,"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics",21100256982,"journal",1.306,"Q1",115,"United States","Northern America","2013-2020","Biotechnology (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Health Information Management (Q1)","6f387d2766e07aa8a29ca27467dc6e4082384ad2",1,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85092908805",28,55286668100,"Wu D.",259,232,1,8,10,81,60029929,"Massachusetts General Hospital","usa","United States","MA",7405862484,"Li Q.",2911,2463,2,28,18,425,60029929,"Massachusetts General Hospital","usa","United States","MA",12,8,8,2.60,660,"2021-02-15","2021-01-11","2020-11-30",0,44,0,2.6,2.6,2.6,"2020-10-12","2021-02-02","2021-2-2",37,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6221020/9281055/09220769.pdf?arnumber=9220769",4

Unfortunately, additional clinically significant treatment options since the approval of remdesivir are scarce. To overcome the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) more efficiently, a treatment strategy that controls not only SARS-CoV-2 replication but also the host entry step should be considered. In this study, we used MT-DTI to predict FDA approved drugs that may have strong affinities for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which are essential for viral entry to the host cell. Of the 460 drugs with Kd of less than 100 nM for the ACE2 receptor, 17 drugs overlapped with drugs that inhibit the interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike reported in the NCATS OpenData portal. Among them, enalaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, showed a Kd value of 1.5 nM against the ACE2. Furthermore, three of the top 30 drugs with strong affinity prediction for the TMPRSS2 are anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs, including ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and paritaprevir. Notably, of the top 30 drugs, AT1R blocker eprosartan and neuropsychiatric drug lisuride showed similar gene expression profiles to potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Collectively, we suggest that drugs predicted to have strong inhibitory potencies to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 through the DTI model should be considered as potential drug repurposing candidates for COVID-19.",2020,1,"Daejeon  34051, South Korea; Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Dankook University, Cheonan, 31116, South Korea","ACE2; coronavirus; COVID-19; deep learning; drug repurposing; SARS-CoV-2; TMPRSS2","serine proteinase; TMPRSS2 protein, human; drug development; drug effect; drug repositioning; drug therapy; Hepacivirus; human; metabolism; procedures; virus entry; virus replication; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Drug Development; Drug Repositioning; Hepacivirus; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Serine Endopeptidases; Virus Internalization; Virus Replication","NLM (Medline)","NLM (Medline)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green","Prognosis, Epidemiology, Etiology",33218024,"Viruses",19700188364,"journal",1.633,"Q1",69,"Switzerland","Western Europe","2009-2020","Infectious Diseases (Q1); Virology (Q1)","ca26e4951d18627cc3e3ccff251a362fb0c0f669",1,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85096814487",5,57210111034,"Choi Y.",118,118,5,1,2,10,124895758,"Daejeon","kor","South Korea",NULL,57216222677,"Beck B.",116,116,2,1,1,5,124895758,"Daejeon","kor","South Korea",NULL,1,1,1,0.25,405,"2020-11-22","2020-11-22","2020-11-17",0,27,0,0.25,0.25,0,"2020-11-18","2020-11-18","2020-11-18",44,"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/11/1325/pdf",3

However, with sudden increases of infected cases, laboratory-based molecular test and COVID-19 test kits are in short supply. Because the virus affects an infected patient's lung, interpreting images obtained from Computed Tomography Scanners and Chest X-ray Radiography (CXR) machines can be an alternative for diagnosis. However CXR interpretation requires experts and the number of experts is limited. Therefore, automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images is required.

As soon as data about the nature of this dangerous virus are collected, the research on the diagnosis of COVID-19 has started to gain a lot of momentum. Today, the gold standard for COVID-19 disease diagnosis is typically based on swabs from the nose and throat, which is time-consuming and prone to manual errors. The sensitivity of these tests are not high enough for early detection. These disadvantages show how essential it is to perform a fully automated framework for COVID-19 disease diagnosis based on deep learning methods using widely available X-ray protocols.

In this work, we firstly examine virus morphological characteristics and propose a novel loss function which aims at virus identification from the given electron micrographs. We take into account of attention mechanism for virus locating and classification from digital images. In order to generate the most reliable estimate of bounding boxes and classification for a virus as visual object, we train and test five deep learning models: R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and SSD, based on our dataset of virus electron microscopy.

Due to its high conservativeness and low similarity with human genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is one of the most favorable drug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of Mpro inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinity ranking and prediction of existing structures of Mpro-inhibitor complexes. This work integrates mathematics (i.e., algebraic topology) and deep learning (MathDL) to provide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 137 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue in Mpro is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followed by Glu166, Cys145, and His163. We also identify 71 targeted covalent bonding inhibitors. MathDL was validated on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark and a carefully curated SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset to ensure the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction.

Before effective vaccines are widely used, it is important to predict the epidemic patterns of COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 is transferred primarily by droplets of infected people, the incorporation of human mobility is crucial in epidemic dynamics models. This study expands the susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered compartment model by considering human mobility among a number of regions. Although the expanded meta-population epidemic model exhibits better performance than general compartment models, it requires a more accurate estimation of the extended modeling parameters. To estimate the parameters of these epidemic models, the meta-population model is incorporated with deep learning models. The combined deep learning model generates more accurate modeling parameters, which are used for epidemic meta-population modeling. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid deep learning framework, COVID-19 data in South Korea were tested, and the forecast of the epidemic patterns was compared with other estimation methods. © 2020 by the authors.

The prolonged restrictions on economic and business activities caused huge economic turmoil that significantly affected the financial markets. To ease the growing pressure on the economy, scientists proposed intermittent lockdowns commonly known as “smart lockdowns”. Under smart lockdown, areas that contain infected clusters of population, namely hotspots, are placed on lockdown, while economic activities are allowed to operate in un-infected areas. In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning prediction framework for the accurate prediction of hotpots. We exploit the benefits of two deep learning models, i.e., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and propose a hybrid framework that has the ability to extract multi time-scale features from convolutional layers of CNN. The multi time-scale features are then concatenated and provide as input to 2-layers LSTM model. The LSTM model identifies short, medium and long-term dependencies by learning the representation of time-series data. We perform a series of experiments and compare the proposed framework with other state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning based prediction models. From the experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed framework beats other existing methods with a clear margin. © 2020 by the authors.

The automation of clinical de-identification through deep learning techniques has proven to be less effective for languages other than English due to the scarcity of data sets. Hence a new Italian de-identification data set has been created from the COVID-19 clinical records made available by the Italian Society of Radiology (SIRM). Therefore, two multi-lingual deep learning systems have been developed for this low-resource language scenario: the objective is to investigate their ability to transfer knowledge between different languages while maintaining the necessary features to correctly perform the Named Entity Recognition task for de-identification. The systems were trained using four different strategies, using both the English Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) 2014 and the new Italian SIRM COVID-19 data sets, then evaluated on the latter.

Deep-learning artificial intelligent (AI) methods have the potential to help improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for reading portable CXRs. Purpose: The study aimed at developing an AI imaging analysis tool to classify COVID-19 lung infection based on portable CXRs. Materials and methods: Public datasets of COVID-19 (N = 130), bacterial pneumonia (N = 145), non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia (N = 145), and normal (N = 138) CXRs were analyzed. Texture and morphological features were extracted. Five supervised machine-learning AI algorithms were used to classify COVID-19 from other conditions. Two-class and multi-class classification were performed. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired two-tailed t tests with unequal variance between groups. Performance of classification models used the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: For the two-class classification, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 100%, 100%, and 100% for COVID-19 vs normal; 96.34%, 95.35% and 97.44% for COVID-19 vs bacterial pneumonia; and 97.56%, 97.44% and 97.67% for COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia. For the multi-class classification, the combined accuracy and AUC were 79.52% and 0.87, respectively.

Methods: In this retrospective study, an AI system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19-infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. Five hundred thirty-one CT scans from 204 COVID-19 patients were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital. The automatically segmented lung abnormalities were compared with manual segmentation of two experienced radiologists using the Dice coefficient on a randomly selected subset (30 CT scans). Two imaging biomarkers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU), to assess disease severity and disease progression. The assessments were compared with patient status of diagnosis reports and key phrases extracted from radiology reports using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Cohen’s kappa, respectively. Results: The dice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19-infected lung abnormalities was 0.74 ± 0.28 and 0.76 ± 0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement (0.79 ± 0.25). The computed two imaging biomarkers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.97 (p value < 0.001). Very good agreement (κ = 0.8220) between the AI system and the radiologists was achieved on evaluating the changes in infection volumes. Conclusions: A deep learning–based AI system built on the thick-section CT imaging can accurately quantify the COVID-19-associated lung abnormalities and assess the disease severity and its progressions.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to aid in rapid evaluation of CT scans for differentiation of COVID-19 findings from other clinical entities. Here we show that a series of deep learning algorithms, trained in a diverse multinational cohort of 1280 patients to localize parietal pleura/lung parenchyma followed by classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, can achieve up to 90.8% accuracy, with 84% sensitivity and 93% specificity, as evaluated in an independent test set (not included in training and validation) of 1337 patients. Normal controls included chest CTs from oncology, emergency, and pneumonia-related indications. The false positive rate in 140 patients with laboratory confirmed other (non COVID-19) pneumonias was 10%. AI-based algorithms can readily identify CT scans with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, as well as distinguish non-COVID related pneumonias with high specificity in diverse patient populations. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,14,"Molecular Imaging Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; Clinical Research Directorate, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, United States; State University of New York-Upstate Medical Center, Syracuse, NY, United States; Center for Interventional Oncology, Radiology and Imaging Sciences, NIH Clinical Center and National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; NVIDIA Corporation, Bethesda, MD, United States; Philips Research North America, Cambridge, MA, United States; Center for Research in Computer Vision, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States; Department of Radiology Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Milano, Milan, Italy; Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Service, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, San Paolo Hospital, Milan, Italy; Postgraduation School in Radiodiagnostics, Università Degli Studi di Milano, Via Festa del Perdono 7, Milan, 20122, Italy; Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano, Milan, Italy; Department of Radiology, Xiangyang NO.1 People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University of Medicine Xiangyang, Hubei, China","","algorithm; artificial intelligence; data set; detection method; laboratory method; model validation; pneumonia; training; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; child; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; false positive result; female; ground glass opacity; human; image analysis; image segmentation; lung parenchyma; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; observational study; predictive value; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; segmentation algorithm; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; three-dimensional imaging; virus pneumonia; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; lung; middle aged; pandemic; preschool child; procedures; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","Nature Research","Nature Research","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,32796848,"Nature Communications",19700182758,"journal",5.569,"Q1",298,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","2010-2020","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous) (Q1); Chemistry (miscellaneous) (Q1); Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous) (Q1)","bd3e894559bbcbd114ab08108767b6efefbeb25e",29,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85089409297",39,57191581147,"Harmon S.",465,397,25,12,10,249,60109509,"Leidos Inc.","usa","United States","VA",9435311800,"Turkbey B.",14458,8073,1,63,17,1214,60013409,"National Cancer Institute (NCI)","usa","United States","MD",248,191,202,197.66,3480,"2021-02-23","2020-08-14","2020-08-13",0,232,0,197.66,124.48,3.5,"2020-08-14","2021-03-11","2020-8-14",27,"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17971-2.pdf",6

We aimed to construct a model integrating information from radiomics and deep learning (DL) features to discriminate critical cases from severe cases of COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) images. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 217 patients from three centers in China, including 82 patients with severe disease and 135 with critical disease. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 174) and a test cohort (n = 43). We extracted 102 3-dimensional radiomic features from automatically segmented lung volume and selected the significant features. We also developed a 3-dimensional DL network based on center-cropped slices. Using multivariable logistic regression, we then created a merged model based on significant radiomic features and DL scores. We employed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate the model's performance. We then conducted cross validation, stratified analysis, survival analysis, and decision curve analysis to evaluate the robustness of our method. Results: The merged model can distinguish critical patients with AUCs of 0.909 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.859-0.952) and 0.861 (95% CI: 0.753-0.968) in the training and test cohorts, respectively. Stratified analysis indicated that our model was not affected by sex, age, or chronic disease. Moreover, the results of the merged model showed a strong correlation with patient outcomes. Significance: A model combining radiomic and DL features of the lung could help distinguish critical cases from severe cases of COVID-19. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,0,"School of Artificial IntelligenceUniversity of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China; Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China; Department of Medical Imaging, Henan Provincial People's Hospital and the People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China; Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, School of Medicine, Beihang University, Beijing, China","computed tomography (CT); COVID-19; deep learning; radiomics","Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Logistic regression; Chronic disease; Confidence interval; Cross validation; Integrating information; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Stratified analysis; Strong correlation; Survival analysis; Deep learning; adult; age; aged; area under the curve; Article; artificial neural network; chronic disease; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross validation; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity; female; human; image segmentation; learning algorithm; lung volume; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; middle aged; radiomics; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; survival analysis; validation process; diagnostic imaging; isolation and purification; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; virology; x-ray computed tomography; Cohort Studies; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Treatment, Etiology",NULL,"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics",21100256982,"journal",1.306,"Q1",115,"United States","Northern America","2013-2020","Biotechnology (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Health Information Management (Q1)","4f52ffdd65ff8e107ce54ab478f34d874921baa9",1,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85097571392",10,57218491144,"Li C.",0,0,2,0,2,24,60027363,"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","chn","China",NULL,57199797077,"Tian J.",18,18,13,2,10,61,108036762,"Beijing Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging","chn","China",NULL,1,1,1,0.25,705,"2021-02-25","2021-02-15","2019-12-31",0,47,0,0.25,0.25,0.25,"2020-11-09","2021-03-03","2020-12-5",35,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6221020/6363502/09252830.pdf?arnumber=9252830",3

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced a major re-thinking in medical education worldwide. In this commentary, we examined the current merits and limitations of the direct ophthalmoscope in both the clinical sense and in the context of infection control. Furthermore, we compared the direct ophthalmoscope with alternatives, including commercially available portable non-mydriatic fundus cameras, that would allow a change in focus during ophthalmic teaching. We concluded that the latter will better prepare our medical students for the age of telemedicine and deep-learning systems. While the COVID-19 pandemic will not be the sole reason for the ‘death’ of the direct ophthalmoscope, the global situation will inevitably serve to expedite long overdue changes in our teaching of ophthalmic skills to non-ophthalmic physicians. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,0,"Department of Ophthalmology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","COVID-19; Direct ophthalmoscopy; Medical education; Pandemic","","Adis","Adis","English","Note","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,32860621,"Ophthalmology and Therapy",21100349513,"journal",0.780,"Q2",13,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","2014-2020","Ophthalmology (Q2)","68ea6881acc3e40dfedd69b3e79b1eff7575a0f0",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85089958424",5,35765776400,"Shih K.",359,350,15,9,12,137,60006541,"The University of Hong Kong","hkg","Hong Kong",NULL,7401939748,"Lai J.",3214,2175,1,29,35,609,60006541,"The University of Hong Kong","hkg","Hong Kong",NULL,6,5,6,9.10,510,"2020-09-14","2020-08-29","2020-08-28",0,34,0,9.1,9.1,0,"2020-08-29","2020-12-01","2020-12-1",8,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40123-020-00295-1.pdf",6

The deep learning community concentrates their efforts on exploring if neural networks can potentially support the diagnosis using CT and radiograph images of patients’ lungs. The two most popular publicly available datasets for COVID-19 classification are COVID-CT and COVID-19 Image Data Collection. In this work, we propose a new dataset which we call COVID-19 CT & Radiograph Image Data Stock. It contains both CT and radiograph samples of COVID-19 lung findings and combines them with additional data to ensure a sufficient number of diverse COVID-19-negative samples.

Therefore, in the present study, 1528 anti-HIV1compounds were screened by sequence alignment between 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and avian infectious bronchitis virus (avian coronavirus) followed by machine learning predictive model, drug-likeness screening and molecular docking, which resulted in 41 screened compounds. These 41 compounds were re-screened by deep learning model constructed considering the IC50 values of known inhibitors which resulted in 22 hit compounds. Further, screening was done by structural activity relationship mapping which resulted in two structural clefts. Thereafter, functional group analysis was also done, where cluster 2 showed the presence of several essential functional groups having pharmacological importance. In the final stage, Cluster 2 compounds were re-docked with four different PDB structures of 3CLpro, and their depth interaction profile was analyzed followed by molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns. Conclusively, 2 out of 1528 compounds were screened as potential hits against 3CLpro which could be further treated as an excellent drug against SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,0,"Environmental Information System on Himalayan Ecology, G.B.

However, these PFT data cannot be directly used in clinical studies, because PFT results are stored in raw image files. In this study, the classification and itemization medical image (CIMI) system generates valuable data from raw PFT images by automatically classifying various PFT results, extracting texts, and storing them in the PFT database and Excel files. The deep‐learning‐based optical character recognition (OCR) technology was mainly used in CIMI to classify and itemize PFT images in St. Mary’s Hospital. CIMI classified seven types and itemized 913,059 texts from 14,720 PFT image sheets, which cannot be done by humans. The number, type, and location of texts that can be extracted by PFT type are all different, but CIMI solves this issue by classifying the PFT image sheets by type, allowing researchers to analyze the data. To demonstrate the superiority of CIMI, the validation results of CIMI were compared to the results of the other four algorithms. A total of 70 randomly selected sheets (ten sheets from each type) and 33,550 texts were used for the validation. The accuracy of CIMI was 95%, which was the highest accuracy among the other four algorithms. © 2020 by the authors.

Considering the limited training cases and resources (e.g, time and budget), we propose a Multi-task Multi-slice Deep Learning System (MLung-Sys) for multi-class lung pneumonia screening from CT imaging, which only consists of two 2D CNN networks, i.e., slice-and patient-level classification networks. The former aims to seek the feature representations from abundant CT slices instead of limited CT volumes, and for the overall pneumonia screening, the latter one could recover the temporal information by feature refinement and aggregation between different slices. In addition to distinguish COVID-19 from Healthy, H1N1, and CAP cases, our MLung-Sys also be able to locate the areas of relevant lesions, without any pixel-level annotation. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on a chest CT imaging dataset with a total of 734 patients (251 healthy people, 245 COVID-19 patients, 105 H1N1 patients, and 133 CAP patients). The quantitative results with plenty of metrics indicate the superiority of our proposed model on both slice-and patient-level classification tasks.

Although computed tomography (CT) scans show a variety of signs caused by the viral infection, given a large amount of images, these visual features are difficult and can take a long time to be recognized by radiologists. Artificial intelligence methods for automated classification of COVID-19 on CT scans have been found to be very promising. However, current investigation of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT data is limited. This study presents an investigation on 16 pretrained CNNs for classification of COVID-19 using a large public database of CT scans collected from COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 subjects. The results show that, using only 6 epochs for training, the CNNs achieved very high performance on the classification task. Among the 16 CNNs, DenseNet-201, which is the deepest net, is the best in terms of accuracy, balance between sensitivity and specificity, F1 score, and area under curve. Furthermore, the implementation of transfer learning with the direct input of whole image slices and without the use of data augmentation provided better classification rates than the use of data augmentation. Such a finding alleviates the task of data augmentation and manual extraction of regions of interest on CT images, which are adopted by current implementation of deep-learning models for COVID-19 classification. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,2,"Center for Artificial Intelligence, Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University, Khobar, 31952, Saudi Arabia","","artificial intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; factual database; human; image processing; information processing; lung; pandemic; pathology; procedures; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Data Management; Databases, Factual; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Nature Research","Nature Research","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,33037291,"Scientific Reports",21100200805,"journal",1.341,"Q1",179,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","2011-2020","Multidisciplinary (Q1)","5a935c81dc668f2a3b779f5c3e5ce308b748a626",5,0,2,1,1,"2-s2.0-85092270792",1,7202226207,"Pham T.",1976,1638,25,23,28,199,60091190,"Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University","sau","Saudi Arabia","Eastern Province",7202226207,"Pham T.",1976,1638,25,23,28,199,60091190,"Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University","sau","Saudi Arabia","Eastern Province",12,7,8,11.60,990,"2021-01-22","2020-10-09","2020-10-08",0,66,0,11.6,11.6,0.75,"2020-10-09","2021-03-10","2020-10-9",27,"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74164-z.pdf",4

In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four classes viz. normal, pneumonia, other_disease, and Covid - 19. A 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the possibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall accuracy was measured as 90.13% ± 0.14. In order to get an idea about the COVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more attention during the classification.

Deep learning neural networks have a great potential for building COVID-19 triage systems and detecting COVID-19 patients, especially patients with low severity. Unfortunately, current databases do not allow building such systems as they are highly heterogeneous and biased towards severe cases.

Iran was one of the first affected countries by this virus. Isfahan, as the third most populated province of Iran, experienced a noticeable epidemic. The prediction of epidemic size, peak value, and peak time can help policymakers in correct decisions. In this study, deep learning is selected as a powerful tool for forecasting this epidemic in Isfahan. A combination of effective Social Determinant of Health (SDH) and the occurrences of COVID-19 data are used as spatiotemporal input by using time-series information from different locations. Different models are utilized, and the best performance is found to be for a tailored type of long short-term memory (LSTM). This new method incorporates the mutual effect of all classes (confirmed/ death / recovered) in the prediction process. The future trajectory of the outbreak in Isfahan is forecasted with the proposed model. The paper demonstrates the positive effect of adding SDHs in pandemic prediction. Furthermore, the effectiveness of different SDHs is discussed, and the most effective terms are introduced. The method expresses high ability in both short- and long- term forecasting of the outbreak. The model proves that in predicting one class (like the number of confirmed cases), the effect of other accompanying numbers (like death and recovered cases) cannot be ignored.

The current researches have suggested that visible irregularities found in the chest X-ray of Covid-19 positive patients are indicative of the presence of the disease. Hence, Deep Learning and Image Classification techniques can be employed to learn from these irregularities, and classify accordingly with high accuracy. This research presents an approach to create a classifier model named StackNet-DenVIS which is designed to act as a screening process before conducting the existing swab tests. Using a novel approach, which incorporates Transfer Learning and Stacked Generalization, the model aims to lower the False Negative rate of classification compensating for the 30% False Negative rate of the swab tests. A dataset gathered from multiple reliable sources consisting of 9953 Chest X-rays (868 Covid and 9085 Non-Covid) was used. Also, this research demonstrates handling data imbalance using various techniques involving Generative Adversarial Networks and sampling techniques. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained on our proposed model were 95.07%, 99.40% and 94.61% respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of accuracy and false negative rate obtained by this paper outperforms the current implementations. We must also highlight that our proposed architecture also considers other types of viral pneumonia. Given the unprecedented sensitivity of our model we are optimistic it contributes to a better Covid-19 detection. © 2020, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.",2020,0,"Department of Computer Engineering, Dwarkadas J.

Method: CAD scheme first applies two image preprocessing steps to remove the majority of diaphragm regions, process the original image using a histogram equalization algorithm, and a bilateral low-pass filter. Then, the original image and two filtered images are used to form a pseudo color image. This image is fed into three input channels of a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify chest X-ray images into 3 classes of COVID-19 infected pneumonia, other community-acquired no-COVID-19 infected pneumonia, and normal (non-pneumonia) cases. To build and test the CNN model, a publicly available dataset involving 8474 chest X-ray images is used, which includes 415, 5179 and 2,880 cases in three classes, respectively. Dataset is randomly divided into 3 subsets namely, training, validation, and testing with respect to the same frequency of cases in each class to train and test the CNN model. Results: The CNN-based CAD scheme yields an overall accuracy of 94.5 % (2404/2544) with a 95 % confidence interval of [0.93,0.96] in classifying 3 classes. CAD also yields 98.4 % sensitivity (124/126) and 98.0 % specificity (2371/2418) in classifying cases with and without COVID-19 infection. However, without using two preprocessing steps, CAD yields a lower classification accuracy of 88.0 % (2239/2544). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that adding two image preprocessing steps and generating a pseudo color image plays an important role in developing a deep learning CAD scheme of chest X-ray images to improve accuracy in detecting COVID-19 infected pneumonia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2,"School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK  73019, United States; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA  95064, United States","Computer-aided diagnosis; Convolution neural network (CNN); Coronavirus; COVID-19 diagnosis; Disease classification; VGG16 network","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Low pass filters; Statistical tests; Transfer learning; Classification accuracy; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Confidence interval; Histogram equalizations; Image preprocessing; Overall accuracies; Pre-processing algorithms; Pre-processing step; Image enhancement; Article; body size; community acquired pneumonia; computer assisted diagnosis; contrast to noise ratio; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; image processing; noise reduction; prediction; priority journal; risk reduction; thorax radiography; transfer of learning; virus pneumonia; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnosis; human; isolation and purification; procedures; virology; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Radiography, Thoracic; SARS-CoV-2; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green",NULL,32992136,"International Journal of Medical Informatics",23689,"journal",0.954,"Q1",99,"Ireland","Western Europe","1996-2020","Health Informatics (Q1)","6458e6fb88a13a235f78b8c8215383167069fcb1",13,0,1,0,1,"2-s2.0-85091572938",6,57200627029,"Heidari M.",164,89,1,7,9,48,60030931,"University of Oklahoma","usa","United States","OK",57202301161,"Zheng B.",228,168,2,8,10,184,60030931,"University of Oklahoma","usa","United States","OK",4,3,3,0.75,561,"2021-02-14","2021-01-16","2020-11-30",0,33,0,0.75,0.75,0.75,"2020-09-23","2021-03-10","2020-11-19",31,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S138650562030959X?httpAccept=text/xml",5

Chest Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective method for detecting lung illnesses, including COVID-19. However, the CT scan is expensive and timeconsuming. Therefore, this work focus on detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images because it is widely available, faster, and cheaper than CT scan. Many machine learning approaches such as Deep Learning, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine; have used X-ray for detecting the COVID-19. Although the performance of those approaches is acceptable in terms of accuracy, however, they require high computational time and more memory space. Therefore, this work employs an Optimised Genetic Algorithm-Extreme Learning Machine (OGA-ELM) with three selection criteria (i.e., random, K-tournament, and roulette wheel) to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. The most crucial strength factors of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are: (i) high capability of the ELM in avoiding overfitting; (ii) its usability on binary and multi-type classifiers; and (iii) ELM could work as a kernelbased support vector machine with a structure of a neural network. These advantages make the ELM efficient in achieving an excellent learning performance. ELMs have successfully been applied in many domains, including medical domains such as breast cancer detection, pathological brain detection, and ductal carcinoma in situ detection, but not yet tested on detecting COVID-19. Hence, this work aims to identify the effectiveness of employing OGA-ELM in detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. In order to reduce the dimensionality of a histogram oriented gradient features, we use principal component analysis. The performance of OGA-ELM is evaluated on a benchmark dataset containing 188 chest X-ray images with two classes: a healthy and a COVID-19 infected. The experimental result shows that the OGA-ELM achieves 100.00% accuracy with fast computation time. This demonstrates that OGA-ELM is an efficient method for COVID-19 detecting using chest X-ray images. © 2020 Albadr et al.",2020,0,"CAIT, Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Communication Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia; Department of Emergency Medicine, Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Bandar Tun Razak, Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","","Article; artificial neural network; autoanalysis; classifier; clinical effectiveness; coronavirus disease 2019; dimensionality reduction; extreme learning machine; genetic algorithm; histogram; human; image analysis; kernel method; machine learning; measurement accuracy; optimised genetic algorithm; principal component analysis; support vector machine; thorax radiography; algorithm; diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; isolation and purification; lung; pathogenicity; pathophysiology; thorax; virology; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; COVID-19; Humans; Lung; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; SARS-CoV-2; Support Vector Machine; Thorax; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Public Library of Science","Public Library of Science","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,33320858,"PLoS ONE",10600153309,"journal",1.023,"Q1",300,"United States","Northern America","2001, 2006-2020","Multidisciplinary (Q1)","694262584c45bc072d9fb707034544a303eeeacf",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85098321778",6,57201726613,"Albadr M.",67,50,1,4,4,15,60001821,"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia","mys","Malaysia","Selangor",6505772576,"Hamzah F.",11,11,2,3,10,41,60001821,"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia","mys","Malaysia","Selangor",6,6,6,1.50,500,"2020-12-26","2020-12-16","2020-12-14",0,25,0,1.5,1.5,1.5,"2020-12-15","2020-12-15","2020-12-15",60,"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242899",2

Respiratory infections occur primarily in the majority of patients treated with COVID-19. In light of the growing number of COVID-19 cases, the need for diagnostic tools to identify COVID-19 infection at early stages is of vital importance. For decades, chest X-ray (CXR) technologies have proven their ability to accurately detect respiratory diseases. More recently, with the availability of COVID-19 CXR scans, deep learning algorithms have played a critical role in the healthcare arena by allowing radiologists to recognize COVID-19 patients from their CXR images. However, the majority of screening methods for COVID-19 reported in recent studies are based on 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although 3D CNNs are capable of capturing contextual information compared to their 2D counterparts, their use is limited due to their increased computational cost (i.e. requires much extra memory and much more computing power). In this study, a transfer learning-based hybrid 2D/3D CNN architecture for COVID-19 screening using CXRs has been developed. The proposed architecture consists of the incorporation of a pre-trained deep model (VGG16) and a shallow 3D CNN, combined with a depth-wise separable convolution layer and a spatial pyramid pooling module (SPP). Specifically, the depth-wise separable convolution helps to preserve the useful features while reducing the computational burden of the model. The SPP module is designed to extract multi-level representations from intermediate ones. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve reasonable performances when evaluated on a collected dataset (3 classes to be predicted: COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal).

A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography. It was found in early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19. Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors’ knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,15,"Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada; Waterloo Artificial Intelligence Institute, Waterloo, Canada; DarwinAI Corp., Waterloo, Canada","","biology; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; human; image processing; pandemic; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Computational Biology; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiography, Thoracic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Nature Research","Nature Research","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,33177550,"Scientific Reports",21100200805,"journal",1.341,"Q1",179,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","2011-2020","Multidisciplinary (Q1)","0e2cb8e30cb7f94777dcd408097f0f85483561c8",415,0,61,1,1,"2-s2.0-85095838561",3,57215776615,"Wang L.",18,17,1,2,1,7,60014171,"University of Waterloo","can","Canada","ON",15073608800,"Wong A.",3742,3134,28,27,17,236,60014171,"University of Waterloo","can","Canada","ON",25,16,18,18.71,8880,"2021-03-10","2020-11-11","2020-11-10",0,146,0,18.708,18.708,1,"2020-11-11","2021-03-11","2020-11-11",46,"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76550-z.pdf",3

According to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of China, negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the key criterion for discharging COVID-19 patients. However, repeated RT-PCR tests lead to medical waste and prolonged hospital stays for COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. Our purpose is to assess a model based on chest computed tomography (CT) radiomic features and clinical characteristics to predict RT-PCR negativity during clinical treatment. Methods: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, 203 mild COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital were retrospectively included (training: n = 141; testing: n = 62), and clinical characteristics were collected. Lung abnormalities on chest CT images were segmented with a deep learning algorithm. CT quantitative features and radiomic features were automatically extracted. Clinical characteristics and CT quantitative features were compared between RT-PCR-negative and RT-PCR-positive groups. Univariate logistic regression and Spearman correlation analyses identified the strongest features associated with RT-PCR negativity, and a multivariate logistic regression model was established. The diagnostic performance was evaluated for both cohorts. Results: The RT-PCR-negative group had a longer time interval from symptom onset to CT exams than the RT-PCR-positive group (median 23 vs. 16 days, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the other clinical characteristics or CT quantitative features. In addition to the time interval from symptom onset to CT exams, nine CT radiomic features were selected for the model. ROC curve analysis revealed AUCs of 0.811 and 0.812 for differentiating the RT-PCR-negative group, with sensitivity/specificity of 0.765/0.625 and 0.784/0.600 in the training and testing datasets, respectively. Conclusion: The model combining CT radiomic features and clinical data helped predict RT-PCR negativity during clinical treatment, indicating the proper time for RT-PCR retesting. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,0,"Department of Emergency Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Nanjing North Street 155, Shenyang, Liaoning Province  110001, China; Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, China; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, China","Computed tomography; COVID-19; Quantitative; Radiomics; RT-PCR","virus RNA; adult; Betacoronavirus; China; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; female; genetics; hospital; human; lung; machine learning; male; middle aged; pandemic; pathology; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Hospitals, Special; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retrospective Studies; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","BioMed Central Ltd","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,33081700,"BMC Medical Imaging",16561,"journal",0.598,"Q2",34,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","2001-2020","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging (Q2)","547c72a3690f60223c9ede3fb8a1e99408c7ba59",1,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85092901121",11,57219470915,"Cai Q.",0,0,1,0,1,10,60008872,"China Medical University Shenyang","chn","China","Liaoning",35313024800,"Zhang L.",1714,1532,2,19,15,349,60008872,"China Medical University Shenyang","chn","China","Liaoning",2,2,2,0.75,816,"2020-12-24","2020-10-29","2020-10-19",0,48,0,0.75,0.75,0.75,"2020-10-20","2021-03-03","2020-10-20",29,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12880-020-00521-z.pdf",4

The commentary introduces the practical validation of some critical components of the strategy, described in three manuscripts detailing recent project results in Asia and Africa. The main phases of a cervical screening program are 1) primary screening of women in the general population, 2) triage testing of the small minority of women that screen positive to determine need for treatment, and 3) treatment of triage-positive women thought to be at highest risk of precancer or even cancer. In each phase, attention must now be paid to safety in relation to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The new imperatives of the COVID-19 pandemic support self-sampled HPV testing as the primary cervical screening method. Most women can be reassured for several years by a negative test performed on a self-sample collected at home, without need of clinic visit and speculum examination. The advent of relatively inexpensive, rapid and accurate HPV DNA testing makes it possible to return screening results from self-sampling very soon after specimen collection, minimizing loss to follow-up. Partial HPV typing provides important risk stratification useful for triage of HPV-positive women. A second “triage” test is often useful to guide management. In lower-resource settings, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is still proposed but it is inaccurate and poorly reproducible, misclassifying the risk stratification gained by primary HPV testing. A deep-learning based approach to recognizing cervical precancer, adaptable to a smartphone camera, is being validated to improve VIA performance. The advent and approval of thermal ablation permits quick, affordable and safe, immediate treatment at the triage clinic of the majority of HPV-positive, triage-positive women. Conclusions: Overall, only a small percentage of women in cervical screening programs need to attend the hospital clinic for a surgical procedure, particularly when screening is targeted to the optimal age range for detection of precancer rather than older ages with decreased visual screening performance and higher risks of hard-to-treat outcomes including invasive cancer. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,1,"OAUTHC, Ile Ife, Nigeria; Women’s Health Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States; Centers for Vulvovaginal Disease, Washington, DC, United States; Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Clinical Genetics Branch, 9609 Medical Center Drive Room 6E544, Rockville, MD  20850, United States","Cervical screening; COVID-19; HPV; Self-sampling; Triage","acetic acid; virus DNA; ablation therapy; cancer risk; cancer screening; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; emergency health service; follow up; health care cost; health care planning; high risk population; human; minority group; nonhuman; Note; pandemic; patient safety; precancer; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; uterine cervix cancer; virus transmission; virus typing; Wart virus","BioMed Central Ltd","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Note","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,33072179,"Infectious Agents and Cancer",5700191215,"journal",0.955,"Q2",32,"United Kingdom","Western Europe","2006-2020","Epidemiology (Q2); Infectious Diseases (Q2); Oncology (Q2); Cancer Research (Q3)","0875d1efc8ba558f2ce4bdc4b5513241d76150c4",1,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85092608643",6,24342964700,"Ajenifuja K.",172,160,1,8,18,86,60110453,"Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex","nga","Nigeria","Ogun",57203666402,"Schiffman M.",894,764,1,13,3,1264,60013409,"National Cancer Institute (NCI)","usa","United States","MD",1,1,1,0.25,612,"2020-10-19","2020-10-19","2020-10-13",0,36,0,0.25,0.25,0,"2020-10-14","2020-10-20","2020-10-20",10,"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13027-020-00325-4.pdf",4

Unprecedented pressures have mounted on each country to make compelling requisites for controlling the population by assessing the cases and properly utilizing available resources. The rapid number of exponential cases globally has become the apprehension of panic, fear and anxiety among people. The mental and physical health of the global population is found to be directly proportional to this pandemic disease. The current situation has reported more than twenty four million people being tested positive worldwide as of 27th August, 2020. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to implement different measures to safeguard the countries by demystifying the pertinent facts and information. This paper aims to bring out the fact that tweets containing all handles related to COVID-19 and WHO have been unsuccessful in guiding people around this pandemic outbreak appositely. This study analyzes two types of tweets gathered during the pandemic times. In one case, around twenty three thousand most re-tweeted tweets within the time span from 1st Jan 2019 to 23rd March 2020 have been analyzed and observation says that the maximum number of the tweets portrays neutral or negative sentiments. On the other hand, a dataset containing 226,668 tweets collected within the time span between December 2019 and May 2020 have been analyzed which contrastingly show that there were a maximum number of positive and neutral tweets tweeted by netizens. The research demonstrates that though people have tweeted mostly positive regarding COVID-19, yet netizens were busy engrossed in re-tweeting the negative tweets and that no useful words could be found in WordCloud or computations using word frequency in tweets. The claims have been validated through a proposed model using deep learning classifiers with admissible accuracy up to 81%. Apart from these the authors have proposed the implementation of a Gaussian membership function based fuzzy rule base to correctly identify sentiments from tweets. The accuracy for the said model yields up to a permissible rate of 79%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Supreme Knowledge Foundation Group of Institutions, Mankundu, India; Department of Information Systems, College of Computer Science and Information Technology, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore, India; Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, VSB Technical University of Ostrava, Czech Republic; Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University, Egypt","COVID-19; Deep learning; Emotional intelligence; Fuzzy rule; Gaussian membership function; Sentiment analysis; Tweets; WHO","Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Membership functions; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Viruses; Current situation; Fuzzy rule base; Gaussian membership function; Global population; Learning classifiers; Negative sentiments; Word frequencies; World Health Organization; Deep learning","Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green",NULL,33013254,"Applied Soft Computing Journal",18136,"journal",1.405,"Q1",124,"Netherlands","Western Europe","2001-2020","Software (Q1)","e9c7f15bf73b4b9432a2a72ae3ad81ec30af58e2",4,0,0,0,1,"2-s2.0-85092457474",6,57200601554,"Chakraborty K.",28,27,1,2,5,7,60115046,"Supreme Knowledge Foundation Group of Institutions","ind","India","WB",57192178208,"Hassanien A.",8684,6479,1,41,25,602,60010294,"Cairo University","egy","Egypt","Cairo",4,1,4,16.50,2261,"2020-12-18","2020-10-06","2020-11-30",0,133,0,16.5,16.5,14,"2020-09-28","2021-02-25","2020-12-4",62,"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S156849462030692X?httpAccept=text/xml",5

Major disruptions to life, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, present an opportunity for a better understanding of the experience of stressors and vulnerability. Faster and better ways of psychological screening and tracking are more generally required in response to the increased demand upon mental health care services. The argument that mental and physical health should be considered together as part of a biopsychosocial approach is garnering acceptance in elite athlete literature. However, the sporting population are unique in that there is an existing stigma of mental health, an underrecognition of mental ill-health, and engagement difficulties that have hindered research, prevention, and intervention efforts. Objective: The aims of this paper are to summarize and evaluate the literature on athletes’ increased vulnerability to mental ill-health and digital mental health solutions as a complement to prevention and intervention, and to show relationships between athlete mental health problems and resilience as well as digital mental health screening and tracking, and faster and better treatment algorithms. Methods: This mini review shapes literature in the fields of athlete mental health and digital mental health by summarizing and evaluating journal and review articles drawn from PubMed Central and the Directory of Open Access Journals. Results: Consensus statements and systematic reviews indicated that elite athletes have comparable rates of mental ill-health prevalence to the general population. However, peculiar subgroups require disentangling. Innovative expansion of data collection and analytics is required to respond to engagement issues and advance research and treatment programs in the process. Digital platforms, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence are useful for mental health screening and tracking in various subpopulations. It is necessary to determine appropriate conditions for algorithms for use in recommendations. Partnered with real-time automation and machine learning models, valid and reliable behavior sensing, digital mental health screening, and tracking tools have the potential to drive a consolidated, measurable, and balanced risk assessment and management strategy for the prevention and intervention of the sequelae of mental ill-health. Conclusions: Athletes are an at-risk subpopulation for mental health problems. However, a subgroup of high-level athletes displayed a resilience that helped them to positively adjust after a period of overwhelming stress. Further consideration of stress and adjustments in brief screening tools is recommended to validate this finding. There is an unrealized potential for broadening the scope of mental health, especially symptom and disorder interpretation. Digital platforms for psychological screening and tracking have been widely used among general populations, but there is yet to be an eminent athlete version. Sports in combination with mental health education should address the barriers to help-seeking by increasing awareness, from mental ill-health to positive functioning. A hybrid model of care is recommended, combining traditional face-to-face approaches along with innovative and evaluated digital technologies, that may be used in prevention and early intervention strategies. ©Luke Balcombe, Diego De Leo.

These automatic solutions will help reduce the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous literature has cast the hate speech detection problem as a supervised text classification task using classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep learning methods. However, work investigating this problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published work on English text. Objective: This study aims to identify hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech. Methods: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to discover the main issues and topics discussed in hate tweets. Results: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data in the Arab region identified that the number of non-hate tweets greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4%) contained a low level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19 hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore, we showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9% of all hate tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19-related hate speech on Twitter was weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also identified the commonly discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics were related to hate speech against China and Iran. Arab users also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and abusive language. This study is the first to analyze hate speech in the context of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in the Arab region. © Raghad Alshalan, Hend Al-Khalifa, Duaa Alsaeed, Heyam Al-Baity, Shahad Alshalan.

This respiratory virus seriously affects human lung functionality. One way to diagnose this illness and find out if the lungs are infected is to evaluate chest X-ray. The evaluation of X-rays is challenging because corona has minor effects on the lungs in the early stages, and other diseases can have a similar effect. In this condition, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) can make a huge contribution and help decision support for healthcare professionals. Deep learning has obtained great results in data analysis recently, but the requirement for a large amount of training data prevents the use deep learning in medical data analysis since it is difficult to obtain a large amount of data from the medical field. This paper proposes an effective deep transfer learning-based model that improves current state-of-the-art systems in COVID-19 detection in chest radiographs. The weights of the DesneNet121 and ResNet50 on the Imagenet have transferred as initial weights, and then the two models have been fine-tuned with a deep classifier with data augmentation to detect three classes of COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia and normal radiographs.

However, the accuracy of existing prediction methods still needs to be further improved. This paper proposes a deep learning model that predicts drug-target interactions through effective strategies: the graphical representation of SMILES based on Graph Isomorphic Network (GIN) and word vector matrices of amino acid sequences based on one-dimensional convolution, which is used to extract features of drug-target pairs for classification prediction. Compared with the previous methods, the proposed method outperforms the existing work with AUC.

The early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia relies on the unique patterns of the chest XRay images. Deep learning is a data-greedy algorithm to achieve high performance when adequately trained. A common challenge for machine learning in the medical domain is the accessibility to properly annotated data. In this study, we apply a conditional adversarial network (cGAN) to perform image to image (Pix2Pix) translation from the non-COVID-19 chest X-Ray domain to the COVID-19 chest X-Ray domain. The objective is to learn a mapping from the normal chest X-Ray visual patterns to the COVID-19 pneumonia chest X-ray patterns. The original dataset has a typical imbalanced issue because it contains only 219 COVID-19 positive images but has 1,341 images for normal chest X-Ray and 1,345 images for viral pneumonia. A U-Net based architecture is applied for the image-to-image translation to generate synthesized COVID-19 X-Ray chest images from the normal chest X-ray images. A 50-convolutional-layer residual net (ResNet) architecture is applied for the final classification task. After training the GAN model for 100 epochs, we use the GAN generator to translate 1,100 COVID-19 images from the normal X-Ray to form a balanced training dataset (3,762 images) for the classification task. The ResNet based classifier trained by the enhanced dataset achieves the classification accuracy of 97.8% compared to 96.1% in the transfer learning mode. When trained with the original imbalanced dataset, the model achieves an accuracy of 96.1% compared to 95.6% in the training from trainby-scratch model. In addition, the classifier trained by the enhanced dataset has more stable measures in precision, recall, and F1 scores across different image classes. We conclude that the GAN-based data enhancement strategy is applicable to most medical image pattern recognition tasks, and it provides an effective way to solve the common expertise dependence issue in the medical domain. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,0,"York University, Dept.of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Toronto, Canada; York University, School of Information Technology, Toronto, Canada; Guangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Guangdong Provincal Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Dapasoft INC., Toronto, Canada","COVID-19; deep learning; GAN; generative adversarial network; image classification","Bioinformatics; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Medical imaging; Network architecture; Pattern recognition; Transfer learning; Viruses; Adversarial networks; Chest X-ray image; Classification accuracy; Classification tasks; Greedy algorithms; Image pattern recognition; Image translation; Imbalanced dataset; Image enhancement","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,NULL,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, BIBM 2020",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"771e1981f6aba5286ffead63bd18a3149f943ccb",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85100351265",4,7402177895,"Liang Z.",351,310,2,11,12,145,60033420,"York University","can","Canada","ON",57216702969,"Chan S.",0,0,2,0,2,6,115563050,"Dapasoft INC.","can","Canada","ON",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2021-01-21","2021-02-09","2021-2-9",0,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9312958/9312977/09313466.pdf?arnumber=9313466",1

It is affecting society at large that includes the global economy and public health too. It was found in recent studies that the novel and unknown nature of this virus makes it more difficult to identify and treat the affected patient in the early stage. In this context, a time-consuming method named reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is being used to detect the positive cases of COVID-19, which requires blood samples of the suspects to diagnose the disease. This paper presents a new deep learning-based method to detect COVID-19 cases using chest X-ray images as the recent studies show that the radiology images have relevant features that can be used to predict the COVID-19. The proposed method is developed for binary classification to identify that a person is infected with COVID-19 or not. A total of 2400 X-ray images are taken for the experimental work. It includes 1000, COVID-19, and 1000, non-COVID-19 images, 200, COVID-19, and 200, non-COVID-19 testing images. The proposed method has been compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods on various statistical parameters which give better results with higher accuracy in diagnosing the COVID-19 cases.

In coping and fighting against COVID-19, the most critical step is to effectively screen and diagnose infected patients. Among them, chest X-ray imaging technology is a valuable imaging diagnosis method. The use of computer-aided diagnosis to screen X-ray images of COVID-19 cases can provide experts with auxiliary diagnosis suggestions, which can reduce the burden of experts to a certain extent. In this study, we first used conventional transfer learning methods, using five pre-trained deep learning models, which the Xception model showed a relatively ideal effect, and the diagnostic accuracy reached 96.75%. In order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy, we propose an efficient diagnostic method that uses a combination of deep features and machine learning classification. It implements an end-to-end diagnostic model. The proposed method was tested on two datasets and performed exceptionally well on both of them. We first evaluated the model on 1102 chest Xray images. The experimental results show that the diagnostic accuracy of Xception + SVM is as high as 99.33%. Compared with the baseline Xception model, the diagnostic accuracy is improved by 2.58%. The sensitivity, specificity and AUC of this model reached 99.27%, 99.38% and 99.32%, respectively. To further illustrate the robustness of our method, we also tested our proposed model on another dataset. Finally also achieved good results. Compared with related research, our proposed method has higher classification accuracy and efficient diagnostic performance. Overall, the proposed method substantially advances the current radiology based methodology, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 cases. © 2020 Wang et al.

The adoption of public health-informed hygienic practices can have a large impact on community transmission of COVID-19 including the wearing of face masks in public settings. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be trained to classify people wearing face masks with impressive accuracy. However, current face mask datasets contain clear, high-resolution close-up images of individuals with face masks which is unrepresentative of the lower fidelity images of distant faces more prominent in urban camera images. This paper proposes a practical deep learning computer vision framework for detection and tracking of people in public spaces and the use of face masks. A custom 6,000 image face mask dataset curated from over 50 hours of urban surveillance camera footage is created in this work. CNN-based detectors trained using the dataset are used to perform person detection and face mask classification. Then, a multi-target tracking module extracts individual trajectories from frame-by-frame detection. By associating detected face masks with tracked individuals, overall face mask usage can be estimated. The framework is implemented on several surveillance cameras along the Detroit RiverWalk, a 5-kilometer pedestrian park connecting various greenways, plazas, pavilions, and open green spaces along the Detroit River in Detroit, Michigan. The detection of park user types is shown to have an average precision of 89% and higher for most person classes with the mask detector having an accuracy of 96%. An interactive web application visualizes the data and is used by park managers to inform management decisions and assess strategies used to increase face mask usage rates. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,0,"University of Michigan, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; University of Central Florida, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Orlando, FL, United States","computer vision; COVID-19; face masks; multi-object tracking","Cameras; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Security systems; Smart city; Target tracking; Wear of materials; Detection and tracking; Interactive web applications; Management decisions; Multi-target tracking; Surveillance cameras; Urban environments; Urban surveillance; Vision frameworks; Computer vision","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Inc.","English","Conference Paper","Final","All Open Access, Bronze",NULL,NULL,"2020 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference, ISC2 2020",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"30b61523bf08bd46546e61f873b1c05d941c3a16",1,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85097191854",3,57220181589,"Draughon G.",0,0,1,0,1,2,122111815,"University of Michigan","usa","United States","MO",57199678735,"Lynch J.",94,88,5,5,12,65,122111815,"University of Michigan","usa","United States","MO",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2020-10-29","2020-12-18","2020-12-18",26,"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9238770/9239001/09239012.pdf?arnumber=9239012",4

It makes use of all the available resources to reduce the disastrous effect of such Black Swan event. This virus causes pneumonia in human being and changes the respiratory pattern (different from common cold and flu). Compared to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) chest X-ray and computed tomography imaging may be reliable and quick to diagnose the COVID-19 patients in the epidemic regions. Above mentioned imaging modalities along with the machine learning techniques can be helpful for accurate diagnosis of the disease and may be assistive in the absence of specialized physicians. Further, ML can improve throughput by accurate figuration of contagious X-ray and CT images for disease diagnosis, tracking and prognosis.In this research, potential of artificial intelligence has been investigated to develop a deep neural network model for rapid, accurate and effective COVID-19 detection from the CT and X-ray images. The proposed method provides robust deep learning technique for binary (COVID vs. NON-COVID) and multi-class (COVID vs. NON-COVID vs. Pneumonia) classification from X-ray and CT images. A 24-layer CNN network has been proposed for the classification. It attains an accuracy of 99.68% and 71.81% on X-ray and CT images, respectively.

It has so far infected around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114,698 lives overall. As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays. Methods: In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases. Results: CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal), the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more training data becomes available. Conclusion: CoroNet achieved promising results on a small prepared dataset which indicates that given more data, the proposed model can achieve better results with minimum pre-processing of data. Overall, the proposed model substantially advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases. © 2020",2020,61,"Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India; Higher Education DepartmentJ&K, India; Lelafe IT SolutionsJ&K, India","Convolutional Neural Network; Coronavirus; COVID-19, Pneumonia viral; Deep learning; Pneumonia bacterial","Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Deep learning; Chest X-ray image; Classification accuracy; Detection and diagnosis; Learning models; Overall accuracies; Pre-processing of data; Precision and recall; Wuhan , China; Deep neural networks; Article; bacterial pneumonia; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; follow up; human; major clinical study; preliminary data; radiodiagnosis; support vector machine; thorax radiography; transfer of learning; virus pneumonia; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; devices; diagnostic imaging; factual database; false positive result; pandemic; procedures; reproducibility; software; thorax radiography; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; False Positive Reactions; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiography, Thoracic; Reproducibility of Results; Software","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Elsevier","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Green",NULL,32534344,"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine",23604,"journal",0.946,"Q1",92,"Ireland","Western Europe","1985-2020","Computer Science Applications (Q1); Health Informatics (Q1); Software (Q1)","c5be849180c12a24b0c7ef6adae7c0259d2b8ca3",123,0,17,1,1,"2-s2.0-85086140653",3,56126522100,"Khan A.",79,76,7,3,7,4,60020458,"Jamia Millia Islamia","ind","India",NULL,57217089851,"Bhat M.",61,61,1,1,1,2,124542962,"Lelafe IT Solutions","ind","India","JK",9,7,7,3.25,5567,"2020-12-02","2020-06-14","2020-10-31",0,295,0,3.25,0.5,0,"2020-05-30",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,9

This study employed deep-learning convolutional neural networks to classify COVID-19 lung infections on pCXR from normal and related lung infections to potentially enable more timely and accurate diagnosis. This retrospect study employed deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning to classify based on pCXRs COVID-19 pneumonia (N = 455) on pCXR from normal (N = 532), bacterial pneumonia (N = 492), and non-COVID viral pneumonia (N = 552). The data was randomly split into 75% training and 25% testing, randomly. A five-fold cross-validation was used for the testing set separately. Performance was evaluated using receiver-operating curve analysis. Comparison was made with CNN operated on the whole pCXR and segmented lungs. CNN accurately classified COVID-19 pCXR from those of normal, bacterial pneumonia, and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients in a multiclass model. The overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.79, 0.93, and 0.79, 0.85 respectively (whole pCXR), and were 0.91, 0.93, 0.88, and 0.89 (CXR of segmented lung). The performance was generally better using segmented lungs. Heatmaps showed that CNN accurately localized areas of hazy appearance, ground glass opacity and/or consolidation on the pCXR. Deep-learning convolutional neural network with transfer learning accurately classifies COVID-19 on portable chest X-ray against normal, bacterial pneumonia or non-COVID viral pneumonia. This approach has the potential to help radiologists and frontline physicians by providing more timely and accurate diagnosis.

Along with the non-therapeutic preventive measurements, scientific efforts are currently focused, mainly, on the development of vaccines and pharmacological treatment with existing drugs. Summarizing evidences from scientific literatures on the discovery of treatment plan of COVID-19 under a platform would help the scientific community to explore the opportunities in a systematic fashion. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the potential drugs and biomedical entities related to coronavirus related diseases, including COVID-19, that are mentioned on scientific literature through an automated computational approach. Methods: We mined the information from publicly available scientific literature and related public resources. Six topic-specific dictionaries, including human genes, human miRNAs, diseases, Protein Databank, drugs, and drug side effects, were integrated to mine all scientific evidence related to COVID-19. We employed an automated literature mining and labeling system through a novel approach to measure the effectiveness of drugs against diseases based on natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and deep learning. We also applied the concept of cosine similarity to confidently infer the associations between diseases and genes. Results: Based on the literature mining, we identified 1805 diseases, 2454 drugs, 1910 genes that are related to coronavirus related diseases including COVID-19. Integrating the extracted information, we developed the first knowledgebase platform dedicated to COVID-19, which highlights potential list of drugs and related biomedical entities. For COVID-19, we highlighted multiple case studies on existing drugs along with a confidence score for their applicability in the treatment plan. Based on our computational method, we found Remdesivir, Statins, Dexamethasone, and Ivermectin could be considered as potential effective drugs to improve clinical status and lower mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We also found that Hydroxychloroquine could not be considered as an effective drug for COVID-19. The resulting knowledgebase is made available as an open source tool, named COVID-19Base. Conclusions: Proper investigation of the mined biomedical entities along with the identified interactions among those would help the research community to discover possible ways for the therapeutic treatment of COVID-19. ©Irena Spasic, Kate Button.",2020,0,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh; College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar; International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Cape Town Component, Cape Town, South Africa; Division of Immunology and South African Medical Research Council Immunology of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pathology, Institute of Infectious Diseases and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa; Wellcome Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa","2019-nCoV; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Dexamethasone; Hydroxychloroquine; Ivermectin; Remdesivir; SARS; SARS-CoV-2; Statin; Statins","","JMIR Publications Inc.","JMIR Publications Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",NULL,"","JMIR Medical Informatics",NULL,NULL,NULL,"-",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"603381d99b66ff891ed37a0f8528f68ab40f8b7a",0,0,0,1,1,"2-s2.0-85097463523",8,57219734934,"Khan J.",0,0,1,0,1,7,60021158,"Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology","bgd","Bangladesh","Dhaka",55457931100,"Rahman M.",1463,1215,2,19,19,229,60021158,"Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology","bgd","Bangladesh","Dhaka",1,1,1,0.25,1545,"2020-11-10","2020-11-10","2020-11-09",0,103,0,0.25,0.25,0,"2020-10-15","2021-03-11","2020-11-10",83,"",4

As a result, the proposed approach can quickly analyze X-ray images in detecting abnormalities in patients with lab-confirmed coronavirus even before clinical symptoms appear. In addition to detecting early abnormalities, area object detection model reveals a finding not seen in the latest cases of COVID-19.

In regular cases, it is hard for developing countries to test cases frequently. The RT - PCR test is a generally utilized analysis framework for COVID-19 case detection. However, by utilizing X-ray image-based programs, recognition can diminish the expense and testing time. So it is important to program an effective recognition system to identify positive cases.

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has been described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the standard test method for the diagnosis of the disease. However, considering that the results of this test are obtained between a few hours and two days, it is very important to apply another diagnostic method as an alternative to this test. The fact that RT-PCR test kits are limited in number, the test results are obtained in a long time, and the high probability of healthcare personnel becoming infected with the disease during the test, necessitates the use of other diagnostic methods as an alternative to these test kits. In this study, a hybrid model consisting of two-dimensional (2D) curvelet transformation, chaotic salp swarm algorithm (CSSA) and deep learning technique is developed in order to determine the patient infected with coronavirus pneumonia from X-ray images. In the proposed model, 2D Curvelet transformation is applied to the images obtained from the patient's chest X-ray radiographs and a feature matrix is formed using the obtained coefficients. The coefficients in the feature matrix are optimized with the help of the CSSA and COVID-19 disease is diagnosed by the EfficientNet-B0 model, which is one of the deep learning methods.

If the DL algorithm achieves a performance equivalent to that achieved by physicians in chest radiography (CR) diagnoses with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, the automatic interpretation of the CR with DL algorithms can significantly reduce the burden on clinicians and radiologists in sudden surges of suspected COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR compared with formal radiology reports. This is a retrospective study of adult patients that were diagnosed as positive COVID-19 cases based on the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction among all the patients who were admitted to five emergency departments and one community treatment center in Korea from February 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020. The CR images were evaluated with a publicly available DL algorithm. For reference, CR images without chest computed tomography (CT) scans classified as positive for COVID-19 pneumonia were used given that the radiologist identified ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or other infiltration in retrospectively reviewed CR images. Patients with evidence of pneumonia on chest CT scans were also classified as COVID-19 pneumonia positive outcomes. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR were 95.6%, and 88.7%, respectively. The area under the curve value of the DL algorithm for the detection of COVID-19 with pneumonia was 0.921. The DL algorithm demonstrated a satisfactory diagnostic performance comparable with that of formal radiology reports in the CR-based diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. The DL algorithm may offer fast and reliable examinations that can facilitate patient screening and isolation decisions, which can reduce the medical staff workload during COVID-19 pandemic situations. © 2020 Public Library of Science.

On the other hand, the aim is to analyze the issue of ethics involved in the use of artificial intelligence, and which ethics would be possible, since there is no case of accountability for artificial intelligence itself, due to the lack of legal personality and legal capacity, stating that only human beings would be able to adopt moral and ethical judgments. Methodology: The methodology used is based on reading a large bibliographic production, as indicated throughout the text. Results: The research intended to bring contributions to the legal debate about the ethical and legal repercussions on the use of artificial intelligence, especially in the health sector, and its inseparable relationship with the theme of data protection, and with respect for fundamental rights and humans. Data protection and the use of artificial intelligence in the highlighted sector, and the implication of ethical issues, are phenomena that are closely related, not least because the area of data protection starts to suffer greater impact precisely with the use of artificial intelligence, with big data, internet of things, deep learning and machine learning. In addition to the need for objective parameters, in the light of principiological laws, and the application of the weighting procedure when faced with so-called “hard cases”, cases involving collision of fundamental rights rules, as in the field of the use of artificial intelligence in combating the Covid pandemic, it is essential to have ethical guidelines, digital ethics in order to identify new perspectives, potential and limits for the use of data and artificial intelligence, focusing on the central value of the human person, disconnecting them it is based on a patrimonial vision about personal data and the use of artificial intelligence, being essential the promotion of human values and the human supervision of such technology, remaining the human control of it. Contributions: The research aims to address some of the critical and sensitive issues involving such fields of study, such as the problem of the lack of effectiveness of ethical principles, legal principles, the insufficiency of principiological laws, and to verify how the issue of the use of artificial intelligence in combating the Covid pandemic has been discussed in national and international doctrine, as well as in jurisprudence, bringing critical reflections about the possibility of facing the generalization of a state of exception, bringing contributions in order to verify which are the best alternatives, in order to avoid the affront to fundamental and human rights in view of such an exceptional situation, and what parameters should be adopted, in order to protect above all the inviolable nucleus of every fundamental right, where human dignity is found, an axial principle of every State Democratic of Law. © 2020, Centro Universitário Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

While various approaches have been published online to tackle this problem, our work presents a systematic study with comprehensive quantitative analysis of different deep learning models on multiple datasets. We experimented with two types of one-stage pedestrian detection models and further optimised their performance with a repulsion loss to address occlusions in crowds. We also propose a distance computation technique with locally adaptive threshold to approximate the actual spatial distance between pedestrians in the real world. In addition, since there is no existing dataset providing ground truth annotations of distances, we manually annotated three public datasets with such information to perform quantitative evaluation of our crowd detection method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that our method achieves good detection performance with improvement provided by repulsion loss.
